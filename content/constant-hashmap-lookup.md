The other day I needed an dictionary / HashMap to look up [abbreviated content types](https://github.com/bbelderbos/pybites-search/issues/5).

## Constant dictionary / hashmap

I wondered how to make it constant and if I could use the nice Python `dict.get(key, key)` idiom to return the key itself if it is not found in the dictionary.

I found the `phf` crate, which is a perfect fit for this it seems. And it supports the `get` method and the `unwrap_or` method to provide a default value if the key is not found.

Another option is `lazy_static` but I read that `phf` enforces immutability more strictly by design and that it can provide more efficient access patterns due to its compile-time optimizations (the data is embedded in the binary).

## `phf` example

I added this code ([commit](https://github.com/bbelderbos/pybites-search/commit/6fb8b032f36c0564e843a0072ee0960ac8f1543f)):

```rust
use phf::phf_map;

static CATEGORY_MAPPING: phf::Map<&'static str, &'static str> = phf_map! {
    "a" => "article",
    "b" => "bite",
    "p" => "podcast",
    "v" => "video",
    "t" => "tip",
};


fn main() {
    for ct in &["a", "b", "p", "v", "t", "not found"] {
        let value = CATEGORY_MAPPING.get(ct).unwrap_or(&ct).to_string();
        println!("{} -> {}", ct, value);
    }
}
```

This prints:

```bash
a -> article
b -> bite
p -> podcast
v -> video
t -> tip
not found -> not found
```

- The `phf_map!` macro creates a constant hashmap.
- The `CATEGORY_MAPPING` is a static variable that holds the hashmap.
- The `get` method is used to lookup the key in the hashmap.
- The `unwrap_or` method is used to provide a default value if the key is not found.
- The `to_string` method is used to convert the value to a string.

Note that you need to enable the `macros` feature in your `Cargo.toml` file:

## Configuring `phf`

```toml
phf = { version = "0.11.2", features = ["macros"] }
```

## Conclusion

With `phf` you can create a constant hashmap in an efficient way. It is a good fit for cases where you need to look up values by key and you want to enforce immutability. ðŸ’¡

And with that you can now use Pybites Search with both `-c a` and `-c article`, `-c b` and `-c bite`, etc. ðŸŽ‰ ðŸš€
