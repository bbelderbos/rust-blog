Welcome to my first blog post on _A Pythonista Learning Rust_. Here, I'll share my journey of learning Rust as a Pythonista.

## Why Rust?

I've been a Python developer for a while now, and I love the language. However, I've been hearing a lot about Rust lately and wanted to explore it further. Rust is known for its performance, safety, and concurrency support, things I have not learned much about it so far.

Popular projects in the Python space that leverage Rust include [Pydantic](https://pydantic-docs.helpmanual.io/) and [Ruff](https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff). At Pycon I saw a talk by Charlie Marsh on how to leverage Rust to speed up the performance of Ruff and I think that gave me the final nudge to start looking into it :)

## Learning Rust

I am looking forward to learning a lot of Rust and see how I can speed up some Python with it. Even if I keep coding in Python, learning Rust will make me a better programmer.

As per our [Pybites](https://pybit.es) motto you have to build projects and share your learning to get the most benefit, hence this blog.

Of course I will heavily use AI tools, most notably [Co-Pilot](https://copilot.github.com) and [ChatGPT](http://chatgpt.com) to help me write Rust code. I will share the meta learning process of how this here too.

And lastly, I am also part of Jim Hodapp's [Rust never sleeps Slack community](https://github.com/Jim-Hodapp-Coaching), and the community is very welcoming and helpful. When learning new skills, it's important to have a community to ask questions and share your progress with (here is [our Python community](https://pybites.circle.so/).

## Tools for this blog

To keep it Rust I use Zola to generate this blog. It's a static site generator written in Rust. Check it out [here](https://www.getzola.org/documentation/getting-started/overview/). On top of that I use the [Terminimal theme](https://github.com/pawroman/zola-theme-terminimal) which is a nice dark theme and goes well with my love for the terminal.

I will share how to get up and running with Zola in a future post.
