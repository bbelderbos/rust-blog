Welcome to my first blog post on _A Pythonista Learning Rust_ where I'll share my journey of learning Rust as a Python developer.

## Why Rust?

I've been a Python developer for a while now, and I love the language. However, I've been hearing a lot about Rust lately and wanted to explore it further. Rust is known for its performance, safety, and concurrency support, things I have not learned much about so far and are fascinating.

Popular projects in the Python space that leverage Rust include [Pydantic](https://pydantic-docs.helpmanual.io/) and [Ruff](https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff). We recently had [Samuel Colvin](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZHvs_j6fuA) (creator of Pydantic) on our Pybites podcast and at Pycon 2024 I saw Charlie Marsh talk about how Rust makes Ruff so fast. This inspired me to dive into Rust.

## Learning Rust

As per our [Pybites](https://pybit.es) motto you have to build projects and share your learning to get the most benefit, hence this blog.

Of course I will heavily use AI tools, most notably [Co-Pilot](https://copilot.github.com) and [ChatGPT](http://chatgpt.com) to help me learn and write Rust code. I will also share how this process goes ...

And lastly shout-out to Jim Hodapp who has a community called [Rust Never Sleeps](https://github.com/Jim-Hodapp-Coaching). When learning new skills it's important to join a community and his is very welcoming and helpful. For Python I recommend you join us [on Circle](https://pybites.circle.so/).

## Tools for this blog

To keep it Rust I use [Zola](https://www.getzola.org) to generate this blog. It's a static site generator written in Rust. The nice dark theme you're seeing here is [Terminimal](https://github.com/pawroman/zola-theme-terminimal) which goes well with my love for the terminal.

I will do another post how I set this up with GitHub Actions to deploy it to [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com).

I am looking forward to learning a lot of Rust and see how I can speed up some Python with it.

Even if I keep doing most of my coding in Python, I expect that learning Rust will make me a better programmer.
