In Python you can use `unittest` (Standard Library) or `pytest` (PyPI) to write tests. In Rust, you can use the `#[cfg(test)]` and `#[test]` attributes to write tests. Let's explore how ...

## Writing a test

To get some boilerplace code, make a library project with `cargo new mylib --lib` and you get this:

```shell
√ rust  $ cargo new --lib testproject
    Creating library `testproject` package
note: see more `Cargo.toml` keys and their definitions at https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/manifest.html
√ rust  $ cat testproject/src/lib.rs
pub fn add(left: usize, right: usize) -> usize {
    left + right
}

#[cfg(test)]
mod tests {
    use super::*;

    #[test]
    fn it_works() {
        let result = add(2, 2);
        assert_eq!(result, 4);
    }
}
```

- `#[cfg(test)]` is a conditional compilation attribute that tells the compiler to only compile the module when running tests.

- `mod tests` is a module that contains all the tests.

- `use super::*;` imports all the functions from the parent module.

- `#[test]` is an attribute that tells the compiler that the function is a test, you prepend it to each test function.

- `assert_eq!` is a macro that checks if the two arguments are equal.

That's it. Now you can run `cargo test` to run the tests. If you want to run a specific test, you can run `cargo test it_works` (similar to `pytest -k`).

## Writing some tests for my CLI alarm project

This both a good and bad project to demo this. Bad because it uses system audio which is hard to test. Good because it's a simple project and has one function I am interested in testing for this article.

Here is the code:

```rust
...
...
pub fn humanize_duration(duration: Duration) -> String {
    let secs = duration.as_secs();
    if secs < 60 {
        format!("{} second{}", secs, if secs == 1 { "" } else { "s" })
    } else {
        let mins = secs / 60;
        let remaining_secs = secs % 60;
        if remaining_secs > 0 {
            format!(
                "{} minute{} and {} second{}",
                mins,
                if mins == 1 { "" } else { "s" },
                remaining_secs,
                if remaining_secs == 1 { "" } else { "s" }
            )
        } else {
            format!("{} minute{}", mins, if mins == 1 { "" } else { "s" })
        }
    }
}
...
...
```

Copying above boilerplace over I got to write these tests:

```rust
#[cfg(test)]
mod tests {
    use super::*;
    use std::time::Duration;

    #[test]
    fn test_short_durations() {
        assert_eq!(humanize_duration(Duration::from_secs(0)), "0 seconds");
        assert_eq!(humanize_duration(Duration::from_secs(1)), "1 second");
        assert_eq!(humanize_duration(Duration::from_secs(30)), "30 seconds");
    }

    #[test]
    fn test_exact_minute_durations() {
        assert_eq!(humanize_duration(Duration::from_secs(60)), "1 minute");
        assert_eq!(humanize_duration(Duration::from_secs(180)), "3 minutes");
        assert_eq!(humanize_duration(Duration::from_secs(3600)), "60 minutes");
    }

    #[test]
    fn test_minute_and_second_durations() {
        assert_eq!(
            humanize_duration(Duration::from_secs(61)),
            "1 minute and 1 second"
        );
        assert_eq!(
            humanize_duration(Duration::from_secs(122)),
            "2 minutes and 2 seconds"
        );
        assert_eq!(
            humanize_duration(Duration::from_secs(333)),
            "5 minutes and 33 seconds"
        );
    }

    #[test]
    fn test_edge_cases() {
        assert_eq!(humanize_duration(Duration::from_secs(59)), "59 seconds");
        assert_eq!(
            humanize_duration(Duration::from_secs(119)),
            "1 minute and 59 seconds"
        );
        assert_eq!(
            humanize_duration(Duration::from_secs(3599)),
            "59 minutes and 59 seconds"
        );
    }
}
```

I could have grouped them all into one test, but I wanted:
- To show how you can write multiple tests.
- To have better naming for each test for readability and targeting.

On the other hand having a test function for each test would be way too verbose.

Unfortunately there is no `parametrize` feature in Rust like in pytest, so this was my "workaround" for now.

Running `cargo test` I get:

```shell
$ cargo test
...
running 4 tests
test tests::test_minute_and_second_durations ... ok
test tests::test_edge_cases ... ok
test tests::test_exact_minute_durations ... ok
test tests::test_short_durations ... ok

test result: ok. 4 passed; 0 failed; 0 ignored; 0 measured; 0 filtered out; finished in 0.00s

$ cargo test edge_ca
...
running 1 test
test tests::test_edge_cases ... ok

test result: ok. 1 passed; 0 failed; 0 ignored; 0 measured; 3 filtered out; finished in 0.00s
```

## Unittest vs integration tests

This has been an example of a unit test: a test that tests a single piece of code, often a single function.

You can also write integration tests in Rust. Integration tests are tests that test the interaction between multiple modules or components.

You can write integration tests in a `tests` directory, I will show here when I cross that bridge ...

## Conclusion

`#[cfg(test)]` is a conditional compilation attribute that tells the compiler to only compile the module when running tests.

Inside that module, you can use the `#[test]` attribute to mark a function as a test and use the `assert_eq!` macro to check if two values are equal.

It seems common to bundle your (unit)tests into the same module as the code you are testing. Integration tests are put inside a dedicated module in a `tests` directory.

There is no `parametrize` feature in Rust like in pytest, so I just bundled my tests into a couple of functions to give more naming and targeting options.
