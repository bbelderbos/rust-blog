            <p>I have been going through the <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rustlings">Rustlings exercises</a> and I have found them to be a great way to practice Rust. üî•</p>
<p>As I said in <a href="/pybites-search-in-rust">a previous post</a>, it's all about pratice. üí°</p>
<p>Rust is also a language that requires some time to get used to, specially when coming from a dynamic language like Python. All of a sudden you have to get used to the strictness of the compiler and the ownership system.</p>
<p>Reading books like <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/">The Rust Programming Language</a> and <a href="https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/programming-rust-2nd/9781492052586/">Programming Rust 2nd ed</a> (both fantastic!), a lot might not stick until you put it into practice, there is a lot to take in!</p>
<p>That's where Rustlings comes in. It's a set of small exercises that you can work through to reinforce what you've learned.</p>
<p>Not only will you write and fix code, you'll also read a lot of code forcing yourself to understand what it does.</p>
<p>And you'll get to see a lot of compiler error messages in the process. Rust is strict and unforgiving so the sooner you get used to that the better.</p>
<h2 id="how-it-works">How it works</h2>
<p>Just follow <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rustlings">the README</a>, the only thing I had to do on my Mac was:</p>
<pre data-lang="bash" style="background-color:#2b303b;color:#c0c5ce;" class="language-bash "><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span style="color:#bf616a;">curl -L</span><span> https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rust-lang/rustlings/main/install.sh | </span><span style="color:#bf616a;">bash
</span></code></pre>
<p>And then <code>cd</code> into the <code>rustlings</code> directory.</p>
<h2 id="watch-mode">Watch mode</h2>
<p>There are various ways you can do the exercises, but I really liked this workflow:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>In the first terminal window, run <code>rustlings watch</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the second terminal window, open the <code>exercises</code> directory in your favorite editor (in my case Vim + fzf for quick file search) and start coding, as soon as you save a file, <code>watch</code> will pick it up and the corresponding tests will run.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Toggling between the two terminal windows writing code + seeing the tests run + reading the error messages, felt like learning on steroids. üí™</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>I'm through ~80% of the 96 exercises and I can say that I've learned a lot: ownership, borrowing, lifetimes, pattern matching, enums, structs, traits, generics, iterators, error handling, writing tests, it's all there! üöÄ</p>
<p>I highly recommend giving it a go, it's a great tool to really solidify what you've learned from reading books and watching videos. You might be surprised how little actually has stuck from any passive learning you've done. ü§Ø</p>
<p>This effective learning also happens when you try to build smaller projects, but <em>Rustlings</em> is a great way to reinforce the basics and fundamental concepts. üìà</p>
