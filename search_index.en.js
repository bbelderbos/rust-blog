have been having a blast learning Rust, now 25 days in a row! 🎉\nWhat has worked\n1. Start building ASAP\nDo a bit of initial study, but leave the theory soon and start building from day one (fake it before you make it).\nBack it up with reading/study, but code every day! Converting Pybites tools, originally written in Python, to Rust kept it fun for me.\n2. Use AI tools\nUse AI for both coding and explaining concepts.\nIt's like having a dedicated research assistant and is much faster than googling or using Stack Overflow. Combined with the first strategy, you are knee-deep in code quickly, which boosts your learning.\n3. Blog about your journey\nBlogging forces you to understand concepts more thoroughly and share your insights. The first strategy ensures you always have content to talk about, and using AI tools, like ChatGPT for research and Co-pilot for writing, you can do this faster and better.\nAdditionally, blogging regularly forces you to put content out there, which also helps with the impostor syndrome that often comes with learning something new. 💡\n4. Find an accountability partner\nFind someone who is further along with the language to guide and encourage you.\nA special shout-out to Jim Hodapp, who has been instrumental in clarifying doubts and supporting my journey.\nSome wins / takeaways\n1. Re-thinking things in Python\nRust’s emphasis on safety and correctness through its strict compiler checks and ownership system has highlighted the areas where Python’s flexibility could potentially lead to bugs and less maintainable code.\nFor example, with the Rust learning experience so far, I am even more eager to use type hints in Python or add stricter validation with Pydantic. These tools add a layer of safety and correctness to Python code, which learning Rust made me more aware of and appreciate more.\nSimilarly, Rust's default immutability makes you reflect on what that can mean for your Python code. It has made me more aware of the potential risks and benefits of mutable data structures, encouraging me to adopt immutability in Python where possible to enhance code safety and maintainability.\nSo a side effect of learning Rust is that I will become a better Python programmer. 🐍\n2. Learning Rust is a journey - it's hard, but rewarding\nRust is a complex language, and the learning curve is steep. But the challenge is what makes it fun and rewarding. 🚀\nI think the most important thing is to not take it all in at once. Break it down into small, manageable chunks, and build something at every step, even if it's small. 💡\nThen gradually expose yourself to more advanced concepts, but be realistic with your timelines.\nI have been mostly doing scripting so far and that's fine, at least I got quite some code written, and even shipped.\nAnd there is something special about the compiler. 😍 It's strict and unforgiving, but it also becomes your best friend.\nThe feeling of accomplishment when you get the code to compile and run is awesome, specially knowing that that code is probably safe and performant. 🎉\n3. Adding an amazing tool to my toolbox\nRust's performance capabilities are impressive. Even though I haven't delved deeply into this aspect yet, I did learn how to integrate Rust into Python.\nSo when I need to write performance-critical code, I can now try to use Rust and integrate it with Python.\n4. Reaffirming the Pybites trifecta\nThe combination of \"building - JIT learning - putting content out\" works beyond Python. It turns out to be an effective template to learn any new language or technology. 😎\nConclusion\nLearning Rust has been useful on many levels, but it's easy to get into tutorial paralysis when learning a new language.\nSo by building concrete tools, using AI, blogging, and finding an accountability partner, I have been able to keep the learning fun and productive. 🚀\nI am only 25 days in, and I have a long way to go. But I am excited to see where this journey takes me over time ... 📈\n","id":"https://rsbit.es/25-days-learning-rust-takeaways/","title":"25 days of learning Rust: what worked + takeaways"},"https://rsbit.es/automating-test-runs-and-checking-coverage/":{"body":"The other day I did a post on testing in Rust and the next logical step is to automate test runs and check coverage. Here's how you can do that:\n\nAutomating test runs using GitHub Actions\n\nThis is quite easy to do with a workflow file that runs the tests on every push and pull request. Here's an example:\n\nExample job\n\nChecking test coverage using tarpaulin\n\nI was wondering if there was an equivalent to pytest-cov in Rust and I found tarpaulin. First install it:\n\nThen run it:\n\nAnd to make it more visual, generate an HTML report (the equivalent of pytest --cov --cov-report=html):\n\nBeautiful:\n\n  \n  \n    \n    \n  \n  \n\nThere you go, two more tools to help you test your Rust code.\n","id":"https://rsbit.es/automating-test-runs-and-checking-coverage/","title":"Automating test runs and checking coverage"},"https://rsbit.es/blog-with-zola/":{"body":"Here is how I am running this blog using Zola.\nWhat is Zola?\n\nZola is a static site generator (SSG), similar to Hugo, Pelican, and Jekyll (for a comprehensive list of SSGs, please see Jamstack). It is written in Rust and uses the Tera template engine, which is similar to Jinja2, Django templates, Liquid, and Twig. source\n\nInstallation\n\nMaybe something more but these were the main steps.\nConfiguration\nThis is my config.toml:\n\n\nbase_url is important for the theme to work correctly (I forgot to update https://example.com at the start and it broke the theme's styling)\ntheme is the name of the theme folder in themes/\ncompile_sass - Sass compilation is required (see theme docs)\nthe settings under [extra] are theme specific.\n\nWriting\nFor each new post, you create a new markdown file in the content folder. The file name should be the title of the post with dashes instead of spaces.\nThe file should start with a TOML front matter block, which is the metadata for the post. Here is an example:\n\nIf you want to add more metadata, you can add it in this front matter block. If you don't want to publish the post yet, you can add draft = true for example.\nThen write the content in markdown beneath this block.\nTo make a new post I made a quick shell script:\n\nBuilding\n\nThis will generate the static site in the public folder.\nThen run a local server to preview the site:\n\nFor convenience I made a Makefile with some aliases including a combined dev command:\n\ncheckout-theme I added later when I git clone'd this repo on a new machine and detected that the theme repo was not cloned automatically.\nDeployment\nI use GitHub Actions to build and deploy the site (so nice!)\nHere is the workflow file (.github/workflows/deploy.yml):\n\nThis workflow will build the site and push the changes to the gh-pages branch upon every push to the main branch.\n\n\nInterestingly ChatGPT overcomplicated this, but I found in Zola's docs that you can actually use shalzz/zola-deploy-action. I only had to update from 0.17.x to 0.18.x to make it work.\n\n\nYou don't have to setup the secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN as it is a default secret provided by GitHub if you use your action for the same repository.\n\n\nI did have to update the \"Workflow permissions\" under GitHub's repo Settings &gt; Actions, to enable \"Read and write permissions\" (Workflows have read and write permissions in the repository for all scopes.), otherwise the action would fail.\n\n\nI also had to set \"Build and deployment\" to \"Deploy form a branch\" (under Settings &gt; Pages) and set the branch to gh-pages + / (root).\n\n\nStatic files\nI did hit one issue when showing images in the post.\nI thought this would work:\n\nHaving the image in my static/ folder, but it didn't show up on the live site.\nI played with the path making it relative and absolute, but in the end, I had to use the image() shortcode with the src attribute pointing to the image in the static/ folder (just the file name, not the full path). See theme docs as well.\nAdd pages\nThis was a bit less straight-forward so I am adding it here as an extra. See commit:\n\nI created a menu_items array in the config.toml with the pages I wanted to add to the menu.\nI created a content/pages folder and added a markdown file for each page using existing templates from the theme (about and archive).\nI also made an content/pages/_index.md, I cannot 100% remember but I think it would not compile without it.\nI could move the post entries to a new content/posts folder (and use the content/posts/_index.md to list the posts), but I decided to keep them in the root content folder for now.\n\nOK that seems easier than it was, but I had to try a few things to get it right. 😅\nAdd search\nYou can enable search in the theme by setting build_search_index = true in the config.toml. This will generate search_index.json and elasticlunr.min.js files in the public folder upon build.\nelasticlunr.js is a lightweight full-text search engine in JavaScript for browser search. The search index is generated from the content of the site upon build, the index is stored in mentioned search_index.json file.\nHere is the commit I made to get search working on this site:\n\n\nI created a templates/search.html file with the search form and results.\n\n\nIt contains the necessary JavaScript to make this work. First we define an idx constant: const idx = elasticlunr.Index.load(window.searchIndex); which we can then use to search the index (idx.search(query)). It returns an array of search results which we then render in the DOM.\n\n\nI added some CSS to style the search results and added the page to the navigation menu with {name = \"Search\", url = \"$BASE_URL/pages/search\"}, in the config.toml.\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    \n    \n  \n  \n\n\n  \n  \n    \n    \n  \n  \n\nAdd a custom domain\nApart from mentioned base_url in the config.toml, you also need to add a CNAME file in the static/ folder with the domain you want to use, e.g.:\n\nThen under the repo's Settings &gt; GitHub Pages, you can add the custom domain. You can also turn on HTTPS there.\nLastly you need to update your DNS settings of your domain provider to point to GitHub's IP addresses, see GitHub's docs.\nConclusion\nZola is a great SSG so far, I am happy with the setup. I like the simplicity of the tool and the speed of the generated site (Rust 📈 -&gt; zola build -&gt; Done in 91ms. for me) and automatic deployment with GitHub Actions. 😍\nIf you're looking for a Rust based SSG solution I hope this post will help you with the setup. 📈\n","id":"https://rsbit.es/blog-with-zola/","title":"How to blog with Zola, a Rust-based static site generator"},"https://rsbit.es/building-website-axum/":{"body":"I managed to make a website using Axum, a web framework for Rust, pretty similar to Flask in its minimalistic approach. Although it's a basic site, I'm happy with the result, and I learned a lot in the process.\n\n  \n  \n    \n    \n  \n  \n\nIn this post, I'll show you how I built a simple artist portfolio site using this framework.\nSetup\n\nI added the following dependencies:\n\nThe code\nFirst I created the main file, src/main.rs, which contains the application setup and the routes.\nThe repo is here.\n\n\nThe handlers module contains the request handlers for the different routes.\nThe s3 module contains the logic to interact with AWS S3 (I ended up simplifying this part for now, see in a bit).\nThe Config struct holds the configuration for the application (the AWS S3 bucket name holding the images). I'm using the Arc type to share this configuration across the application.\nThe dotenv crate is used to load environment variables from a .env file, see this article. I added an .env-template file in the repo to show you what variables you need to set.\nThe tracing and tracing-subscriber crates are used for logging.\nThe tower-http crate is used to serve static files from the static directory, which I happily got working for this app too.\nThe askama crate is used for templating, which I'll show that in the handlers section.\nThe tokio crate is used for async I/O.\nThe axum crate is the web framework itself and serves the application.\n\nCreating the handlers\n\n\nThe handlers module contains the request handlers for the different routes.\nThe askama crate is used for templating. I created two templates, about.html and portfolio.html, which are rendered by the handlers.\nThe about_handler function renders the about.html template, passing the image URL and the current page name, which I use to highlight the current page in the navigation bar.\nThe portfolio_handler function renders the portfolio.html template, passing a list of image URLs and the current page name.\nThe s3::get_images function is a placeholder for now, returning a HashMap of image URLs from the S3 bucket. I'll show you how I implemented this function in the next section. I did have to convert the HashMap to a Vec of tuples to get the template to work, as I couldn't get it to work with a HashMap directly.\n\nRetrieving images from AWS S3\n\n\nThe s3 module contains the logic to interact with AWS S3. I had this working at some point with the rusoto* crates, but I ended up simplifying it for this first iteration (old s3 code still here).\nFor now I am just returning a HashMap of image full + thumb URLs, but in a real-world scenario, you might fetch the images from a bucket (and only a few per request using pagination).\nI used ChatGPT to make some nice artist work images and made another Rust script to resize them (will post it soon here ...)\n\nTemplates and static files\nI'm using the askama crate for templating. I created two templates, about.html and portfolio.html, which extend a base.html template. The about.html template contains some fake text about the artist, and the portfolio.html template displays a list of images.\n\nThis is the portfolio.html template:\n\nNote here I only managed to loop through a Vec of tuples, not a HashMap directly, so I had to convert the HashMap to a Vec of tuples in the handler (see above).\nI also added some CSS classes to the images and lightbox to make them look nice (you can find the CSS here). This is why you see a loop.index in the template, which is used to generate unique IDs for the lightbox.\nAnd finally, the base.html template:\n\nI like that apart from templating (and inheritance with them), I got static files to work so I could add a style.css file to style the page.\nThe static folder is served by the tower-http crate, which I added to the Router in the main file. It can also serve other static files like images, fonts, etc.\nAs mentioned before I also check each navigation item to see if it's the current page, and if so I add the active class to highlight it in the navigation bar.\nConclusion and next steps\nI managed to build a simple artist portfolio site using Axum, a web framework for Rust. It's still a basic site, but I'm happy with the result so far 🚀\nOf course I heavily used ChatGPT to get this working, but I learned so much faster this way, libraries like Axum and Askama make most sense when you start to use them in the context of a project.\nJust reading about them won't get you anywhere near being able to use them effectively. There's still a lot to learn, but this gave me some good basic insights how to build a website with Rust. 💡\nAgain you can find the code in the repo.\n\nI want to further explore how to interact with AWS S3, and I want to learn how to add a contact form to also handle form data and send emails. 📈\nI also managed to deploy the site to Heroku, which I'll discuss soon here, it was really easy to do. 😍\nWhat will you build with Axum?

They are both great tools for managing your projects and dependencies.\nFunny enough, in Python I actually stopped using poetry in favor of venv and pip because I felt this was faster and all I needed. But in Rust so far I feel Cargo is more integrated and I am using it more (well, don't have much choice, have I? 😅).\nI think it's mainly because I don't have to deal with virtual environments in Rust, which is a big plus. Also it infers the binary name from the project name, which is nice. 📈\nThis post was just to quickly compare Cargo and Poetry and show you how similar they are.

It's best practice to print the error message to stderr (using eprintln) and exit the script with a non-zero status code (Unix convention).\nI used the regex crate to make a regex pattern from the search terms. I had to escape the search terms because they could contain special characters. I used the regex::escape function for this.\nI needed the as_deref method to convert the Option&lt;String&gt; to an Option&lt;&amp;str&gt;. This is useful because I wanted to pass the content type to the search_items function, which accepts an Option&lt;&amp;str&gt;. I still need to get used to the ownership and borrowing rules in Rust, but I am getting there. It will become more intuitive with more practice ...\nLastly I passed the parsed arguments to the search_items function.\n\nThis looks pretty clean and the pleasant way of defining CLI interfaces this way reminds me of Python's Typer library.\nTyper also uses type annotations (and other beautiful abstractions) to make it easy to define CLI interfaces.\nHere is an example for comparison:\n\nConclusion\nI am happy with the new 0.5.0 version of Pybites Search, which thanks to Clap has a much nicer command-line interface.\nClap reminds me of Typer in Python, which makes it easy to define CLI interfaces using type annotations.\nI will surely use Clap in future command-line apps, it's a great library to work with.\n","id":"https://rsbit.es/command-line-apps-with-clap/","title":"Building a nice command-line interface with Clap"},"https://rsbit.es/constant-hashmap-lookup/":{"body":"The other day I needed an dictionary / HashMap to look up abbreviated content types.\nConstant dictionary / hashmap\nI wondered how to make it constant and if I could use the nice Python dict.get(key, key) idiom to return the key itself if it is not found in the dictionary.\nI found the phf crate, which is a perfect fit for this it seems. And it supports the get method and the unwrap_or method to provide a default value if the key is not found.\nAnother option is lazy_static but I read that phf enforces immutability more strictly by design and that it can provide more efficient access patterns due to its compile-time optimizations (the data is embedded in the binary).\nphf example\nI added this code (commit):\n\nThis prints:\n\n\nThe phf_map! macro creates a constant hashmap.\nThe CATEGORY_MAPPING is a static variable that holds the hashmap.\nThe get method is used to lookup the key in the hashmap.\nThe unwrap_or method is used to provide a default value if the key is not found.\nThe to_string method is used to convert the value to a string.\n\nNote that you need to enable the macros feature in your Cargo.toml file:\nConfiguring phf\n\nConclusion\nWith phf you can create a constant hashmap in an efficient way.

Your IDE might also proactively warn you about it.\nOverall type hints are a good practice in Python, they make your code more readable and bring some of Rust's strictness to Python. 💡 😍 📈\nAnother example of enforcing immutability in Python is using frozen=True on a dataclass.\nNow let's look at Rust. You define constants using the const keyword and define the type explicitly:\n\nThe &amp;str type is a reference to a string, which avoids copying data around. In contrast, String is a heap-allocated string.\n&amp;str does not allocate memory itself; it references an existing string slice. This is more efficient for passing around string literals, which are stored in the program's binary and are immutable, making &amp;str ideal for constants.\nThe key point is that you cannot override these values; the compiler will raise an error.\nRust also has a static keyword which is used for global variables, but that's a topic for another article.\nIn both Python and Rust, you can define enums to group related constants together, but that's a topic for another article too.\nConclusion\nBoth Python and Rust have clear conventions for defining constants. Rust enforces immutability strictly at the language level, while in Python, you can achieve a similar level of strictness by using type hints.\nEach language offers tools and conventions that help maintain the integrity of your constants, ensuring reliable and predictable behavior in your programs.\n","id":"https://rsbit.es/constants-python-vs-rust/","title":"Constants in Python vs Rust"},"https://rsbit.es/convert-markdown-to-html-script/":{"body":"In my journey of learning Rust, I decided to pick a small Python program that converts markdown files to html + makes an index page for those files, and rewrite it in Rust.\nTo learn the syntax and also see if I could speed it up.\nIn this post, I’ll walk you through the script and how I run it in a GitHub Action to automatically generate a zip file of the HTML files and upload it as an artifact.\nThis is in the context of a new set of Python exercises I’m working on called Newbie Bites Part II.

Config section you want to separate config from code:\n\nApps sometimes store config as constants in the code. This is a violation of twelve-factor, which requires strict separation of config from code.\n\nSee The twelve-factor app - III. Config for more details.\nBasically, you want to be able to make config changes independently from code changes. 💡\nWe also want to hide secret keys and API credentials! Notice that git is very persistent (see this PyCon talk for example) so it’s important to get this right from the start.\nLoading environment variables in Rust\nYou can load in environment variables like this in Rust:\n\nBut that requires you to set the environment variables before running your program (export MY_VAR=my_value from the command line). This is not ideal for production code and even for local development, it can be cumbersome.\nIt's common to keep a local .env file with your environment variables (don't forget to add this file to your .gitignore!)\nUsing the dotenv crate 📈\nResearching how you can do this in Rust, I stumbled upon the dotenv crate, which makes handling environment variables straightforward.\nFirst, add the crate to your Cargo.toml:\n\nSecondly, you create an .env file in the root of your project:\n\nAgain it’s important that you ignore this file with git, otherwise, you might end up committing sensitive data to your repo/project. 😱\nIgnoring .env in git\nNot sure what the Rust standard is, a standard Rust .gitignore file does not include the .env pattern, Python's one does.\nWhat I usually do (in Python) is commit an empty .env-example (or .env-template) file so other developers know what they should set.\nSo a new developer (or me checking out the repo on another machine) can do a cp .env-template .env and populate the variables. As the (checked out) .gitignore file contains .env, git won’t show it as a file to be staged for commit.\nExample using dotenv\nTo load in the variables from this file, we use a few lines of code:\n\n\ndotenv().ok() loads the environment variables from the .env file.\n.expect is used to handle the case where the environment variable is not set.\n\nWith this setup, you can now access your environment variables using env::var:\n\nThis is because we didn't set the environment variables yet in .env, doing so:\n\nNow it works as expected 🎉\n\nThis is actually pretty similar to Python using the python-dotenv library. 🐍\n\nFor boolean values, a common requirement for configuration settings like DEBUG, you can use env::var and parse the string to a boolean like this:\n\n\nThis works when setting DEBUG=true or DEBUG=false in your .env file.\n.map is used to convert the string to a boolean.\nThe final unwrap_or is used to handle the case where the environment variable is not set or contains an invalid value.\n\nConclusion\nHandling environment variables in Rust is straightforward using the dotenv crate. This approach keeps your configuration separate from your code, making it easier to manage and secure.\nI hope this article helps you to keep your environment variables safe and secure. 🛡️\nHappy coding! 🦀\nThis article is an adaption from our Python article: How to handle environment variables in Python.\n","id":"https://rsbit.es/environment-variables-rust/","title":"How to handle environment variables in Rust"},"https://rsbit.es/exception-handling-in-rust/":{"body":"I am working on an AWS Lambda function to validate Rust code submitted from our coding platform.

The function returns the output of the command if it is successful, or an error message if it fails:\n\nHere is the equivalent code in Python:\n\nRust and Python Error Handling Comparison\n\n\nIn Rust, we use the Result type (Ok/Err) to represent success or failure, while in Python, we use exceptions.\n\n\nRust requires explicit handling of both success and failure cases, while Python allows for more flexible error handling.\n\n\nRust's error handling is enforced at compile time, while Python's error handling is checked at runtime.\n\n\nRust's pattern matching allows for concise and clear error handling, while Python's exception handling requires less boilerplate, it's more flexible, but can also lead to more runtime errors (because they are detected later).\n\n\nIn Python you have to specifically catch the FileNotFoundError exception (and fall back to a generic Exception), while in Rust, it is handled by the Err case of the match statement which could include any error that occurs during the execution of the command.\n\n\nConclusion\nPython's exception handling allows for rapid and flexible development, making it easier to write code quickly. However, this same flexibility can lead to more runtime errors because errors are often detected later (at runtime) and it's easier to overlook proper error handling.\nRust, on the other hand, enforces more rigorous error handling at compile time, leading to more reliable and predictable code, though it can be more verbose and require more upfront effort.\nThis is just a small example, when I get into more nuances of error handling in Rust, I will follow up with a more detailed post. I also understand there are some common crates you can use like anyhow to make error handling in Rust more concise and flexible.

Turning your code into the latter is useful when you want to reuse the code in the script in other projects.\nCompare it to a script vs a package in Python. In Python you can write a script and then turn it into a package by adding an __init__.py file. In Rust you can write a script and then turn it into a library by moving the code into a library project. Let's see how to do this ...\nWriting a script\nLet's start by writing the simplest script that prints a greeting to the console. And a main function that calls the hello function with a name:\nCreate a new project called project:\n\nAnd edit the src/main.rs file to contain the following code:\n\nThis script defines a hello function that takes a name as an argument and prints a greeting to the console. The main function calls the hello function with the name \"Alice\" (no command line arguments, this is for example's sake).\nTurning the script into a library\nTo turn the script into a library, we need to create a new library project and move the code from the script into the library. We can do this by running the following commands:\n\nThe --lib flag tells Cargo to create a library project instead of a binary project.\nThis will create a new library project called my_library and move the code from the script into the library. The lib.rs file is the entry point for the library, and it contains the code that will be executed when the library is used.\nUsing the library\nTo use the library in the first project, we need to add it as a dependency in the Cargo.toml file of the project. We can do this by adding the following line to the Cargo.toml file of the project:\n\nNormally you would list one or more crates from crates.io in the dependencies section, but in this case we are using a relative path to the library project.\nWe can now use the library in the project by importing it and calling the hello function. Create main.rs again (it was previously moved to the library) under src in the project and add the following code to it:\n\nThe path works, because ALE complains about the next thing:\n\nRust makes functions private by default. So back in the library I need to make the function public explicitly by adding pub in front of it in lib.rs:\n\nAnd then it works:\n\nI do get this warning that the main function in the library is never used, which makes sense, because unlike a binary project, the library is not an executable. Therefor I can remove the main function from the library, no more warnings:\n\nSimilar to Python where you can do import pathlib as well as from pathlib import Path, you can do the same in Rust. You can import the whole library with use my_library; or just the hello function with use my_library::hello;.\n\nAnd that'll work equally well.\nSometimes people opt for the first option, because it's more explicit where the function comes from (my_library::hello vs hello). But in this case it's a bit overkill, because there's only one function in the library.\nConclusion\nWe learned how to make a library as opposed to a script (binary) in Rust (which is what I have mostly done up until this point). This is useful when you want to reuse the code in the script in other projects.\nWe also learned how to use the library in another project and the fact that Rust makes module functions private by default (another example where it's more strict than Python!)\nThis is a good thing because it forces you to think about what you want to expose to the outside world.\nWe also learned about the two ways to import functions from a library: importing the whole library or just the function you need. And lastly the fact that libraries don't have a main function, because they are not executables.\nNow you know how to write libraries in Rust so you can write code that is easier to reuse and maintain. 😍 🎉 📈\n","id":"https://rsbit.es/from-script-to-library-in-rust/","title":"From script to library in Rust"},"https://rsbit.es/linting-with-clippy/":{"body":"In Python you often use flake8, pyflakes and/or ruff to lint your code.

However, I've been hearing a lot about Rust lately and wanted to explore it further. Rust is known for its performance, safety, and concurrency support, things I have not learned much about so far and are fascinating.\nPopular projects in the Python space that leverage Rust include Pydantic and Ruff. We recently had Samuel Colvin (creator of Pydantic) on our Pybites podcast and at Pycon 2024 I saw Charlie Marsh talk about how Rust makes Ruff so fast. This inspired me to dive into Rust.\nLearning Rust\nAs per our Pybites motto you have to build projects and share your learning to get the most benefit, hence this blog.\nOf course I will heavily use AI tools, most notably Co-Pilot and ChatGPT to help me learn and write Rust code. I will also share how this process goes ...\nAnd lastly shout-out to Jim Hodapp who has a community called Rust Never Sleeps. When learning new skills it's important to join a community and his is very welcoming and helpful. For Python I recommend you join us on Circle.\nTools for this blog\nTo keep it Rust I use Zola to generate this blog. It's a static site generator written in Rust. The nice dark theme you're seeing here is Terminimal which goes well with my love for the terminal.\nI will do another post how I set this up with GitHub Actions to deploy it to GitHub Pages.\nI am looking forward to learning a lot of Rust and see how I can speed up some Python with it.\nEven if I keep doing most of my coding in Python, I expect that learning Rust will make me a better programmer.\n","id":"https://rsbit.es/my-first-post/","title":"Hello World"},"https://rsbit.es/namedtuple-in-rust-struct/":{"body":"When exploring a new language after Python, one of the first things you might look for is a similar Python types, and one of my favorite ones is the namedtuple.\nIt's a simple way to create a class with named fields, and it's very useful when you want to create a simple data structure.\nPython named tuples\n\nNamed tuples are more readable\nI am such a big fan of named tuples because unlike regular tuples they let you access the fields by name, which makes your code more readable and less error-prone.\n\nNamed tuples are immutable\nNamed tuples are also immutable, which is a good thing because it makes the code safer (you can't accidentally change the values).\nThis is a core concept in Rust I learned, where data structures are immutable by default. If you want mutability, you have to explicitly make them mutable. We'll see how to do that in the Rust in a bit ...\nRust offers structs\nIn Rust, you can use a struct with named fields to create the same Person type as before. Here's how you can do it:\n\nThis prints:\n\n(Ommitting the cargo run command from here on.)\nNotice that if I uncomment the line person.age = 31; the Rust compiler will complain. I am really impressed by with how helpful the Rust compiler is. It gives you very helpful and specific error messages. Here's what it says in this case:\n\nSo as per the error message, you can make the struct mutable by adding the mut keyword before the variable name:\n\nThis works and prints:\n\nImplement methods\nOptionally you can implement methods on the struct to make it more powerful. Here's an example:\n\nWhich prints:\n\nIn Rust, you can enhance your structs by implementing methods using the impl block. This allows you to define functions that operate on instances of your struct, providing a cleaner and more encapsulated way to manage data + associated behaviors (think properties and methods in Python classes).\nThe greet(&amp;self) method is an instance method that takes an immutable reference to the struct (= &amp;self), similar to how Python methods take self as their first parameter. This method simply prints a greeting using the struct's fields.\nThe reference part here touches upon the concept of ownership and borrowing in Rust. Ownership is a big and important concept in Rust, and I'll cover it here more in detail when I have a better understanding of it ...\nConclusion\nIn Rust, you can use a struct with named fields to achieve the same thing as a Python namedtuple.\nStructs are immutable by default, but you can make them mutable by adding the mut keyword before the variable name.\nOptionally, you can implement methods on the struct using the impl block. 🦀😎\nI find the Rust compiler very helpful with its detailed and specific error messages. It helps a lot, specially when you're learning the language. 😍💡📈\n","id":"https://rsbit.es/namedtuple-in-rust-struct/","title":"Does Rust have a similar NamedTuple type?"},"https://rsbit.es/ownership-and-borrowing/":{"body":"In Python, this code runs just fine:\n\nWhen I pass person to print_person, the ownership of person is not moved to the function. I can still use person after the function call.\nIn Rust, the same code will not compile:\n\nThe Rust compiler gives this nicely descriptive error message:\n\nWhat happens here is that person is moved to print_person, and I can't use it after that. This is because Rust is strict about ownership and borrowing.\nThis definitely takes some time to get used to, but it's a powerful and important feature of Rust.\nIt helps prevent memory-related bugs (e.g., use-after-free, double-free, dangling pointers, memory leaks) that are common in other languages that manage memory manually (e.g., C and C++).\nThe solution is to borrow person instead of moving it:\n\nHere we pass a reference instead of the value itself. Note that you have to express this explicitly with &amp; in the function signature and when calling the function.\nIn Rust speak person is borrowed by print_person. This way the function can use person without taking ownership of it.\nKey Takeaways:\n\n\nIn Rust, passing ownership to a function means the original variable can no longer be used. This is to prevent multiple owners of the same data, which can lead to bugs and memory leaks. It also helps with performance and concurrency.\n\n\nIn Python, variables are references, so they remain valid after being passed to functions. Additionally, you don't have to worry about memory management because Python's garbage collector automatically handles the allocation and deallocation of memory (it tracks object references and uses reference counting and cyclic garbage collection to free memory that is no longer needed).\n\n\nRust's borrowing allows you to pass references to functions without transferring ownership, preserving the original variable’s validity.\n\n\nMutability and borrowing\nIn Rust, you can have multiple immutable references to the same data, but only one mutable reference. Additionally, you have to explicitly declare that you want to mutate the data.\nIn Python, the burden is on the programmer to ensure that data is not modified when it shouldn't be. Python doesn't distinguish between mutable and immutable references explicitly.\n\nFor example here my_list is modified inside modify_data function. In Rust, this would not compile because my_list is borrowed immutably by modify_data:\n\nThe Rust compiler will give this error:\n\nIn Rust, to modify data within a function, you must pass a mutable reference using &amp;mut. This ensures that only one mutable reference exists at a time, preventing data races and ensuring memory safety.\n\nNote: This is for example's sake. I don't like mutating outer scope data inside functions. A more functional approach would be to return the modified data.\nConclusion\nUnderstanding ownership and borrowing is a key concept in Rust. It can be frustrating at first, but it's a powerful feature that helps prevent bugs and makes your code more reliable. Rust achieves a balance between performance and safety, leveraging its strict ownership model to prevent common programming errors while still being highly performant.\nPython uses a different approach to memory management, relying on garbage collection to handle memory allocation and deallocation so you generally don't have to worry about these details.\nI still have a lot to learn about the nuances of ownership and borrowing in Rust, but I hope this post gives you a good starting point.\n","id":"https://rsbit.es/ownership-and-borrowing/","title":"Ownership and borrowing in Rust"},"https://rsbit.es/pages/":{"body":"","id":"https://rsbit.es/pages/","title":""},"https://rsbit.es/pages/about/":{"body":"Hi there, I am Bob Belderbos, a Python developer and coach with a passion for teaching &amp; learning programming.

It's called cli-alarm and it's a simple command line tool to play an alarm sound after a specified amount of time. It has an option to repeat the alarm at regular intervals as well.\nWhy this project?\nI created it because I wanted to play an alarm sound from the terminal as a reminder to take a break from the computer every hour, we progammers tend to sit for too long without moving which is really bad!\nI had built this with Python before, but I wanted to try it with Rust this time. And that's actually a good way to learn a new language: by building something you've already built with another language. You already know what you want to build, so you can focus on the new language.\nHow to use it?\nHere's how you can use it:\n\nCurious how it got this alias? It's because of the [[bin]] section in the Cargo.toml file:\n\nLearnings\nCode so far here.\nA couple of cool things I learned while building this:\n\nI used clap  again for the CLI, great library, see also this article.\n\nLike last time I am using attributes (derive macros) to define the CLI interface which is pretty concise:\n\nThis time around I learned that clap also supports environment variables. Here I use it to set the alarm sound file if not provided as an argument.\n\nI used the rodio crate to play the alarm sound. It's a simple and easy-to-use audio library. Next step is to figure out how to play an audio message in addition to the alarm sound.\n\n\nThat's a lot of unwrapping, I should probably handle the errors more gracefully, still a lot to learn ...\n\nI used the chrono crate to print the current time in the log messages:\n\n\nUnlike Python's datetime, Rust doesn't have a built-in way to format dates and times, so you need to use a crate for that. This is a common pattern in Rust: the standard library is kept small and you use crates for additional functionality.\nOther notable Python Standard Library packages you'll miss as a Pythonista for example are: random, re, csv, and json, but once you get used to just cargo adding the crates you need, you hardly notice the difference.\n\n\nI used the reqwest crate to download the default alarm sound. It's a simple and easy-to-use HTTP client, which I had already used for my Pybites Search app, see here.\n\n\nWhere in Python you use while True: to create an infinite loop, in Rust you use loop { ... }.\n\n\nYou can use thread::sleep to pause the execution of the program for a specified amount of time, which seems a fit for this app.\n\n\nLike Python, Rust has a Path struct (object) to work with file paths in a platform-independent way. I like structs in Rust, see also here.\n\n\nI use cfg!(target_os = \"windows\") to check if the OS is Windows. This is a built-in macro in Rust (in Python you'd use sys.platform or the platform module).\n\n\nImprovement ideas / next steps\nAlthough this is not very good Rust code yet, I'm happy with the progress so far, specially having a working program that does something useful.\nSome things to improve:\n\n\nPlay an audio message as mentioned.\n\n\nDownload the default alarm file to a sensible location or maybe a temp dir to not clutter the user's filesystem.\n\n\nHandle errors more gracefully, e.g. using Result instead of unwrap to better propagate errors.\n\n\nModularize the code more to learn how to work with multiple files / modules.\n\n\nLinting and formatting (and automate this with a pre-commit hook as I tend to do with Python, see here).\n\n\nAdd documentation (and host it somewhere, e.g. GitHub Pages).\n\n\nAdd tests (although this app being heavy on IO and time-based, probably not the best app to start to learn about testing in Rust lol).\n\n\nSo good for a couple of more articles here ...\nConclusion\nThe best way to learn is to build small projects! This way you learn to put things together which is an important skill in programming. You can also gradually increase the complexity of the projects you build.\nI'm happy with the progress so far and how this way of learning Rust constantly challenges me to learn more about the language and tooling.

I did an overview video of them you can watch here.\nRust's Approach\nRust, on the other hand, implements these functionalities as methods on iterator types.\nThis approach leverages Rust's strengths in type safety and performance. By chaining methods, Rust allows you to build complex operations in a concise and readable manner.\nExample Comparisons\nLet's compare some common operations using Python built-ins and Rust method chaining:\nmap\nPython:\n\nRust:\n\nfilter\nPython:\n\nRust:\n\nzip\nPython:\n\nRust:\n\nenumerate\nPython:\n\nRust:\n\nHow Method Chaining Works in Rust\nRust’s method chaining is possible because each method in the iterator chain returns another iterator. This allows you to call multiple methods in sequence. Here's a deeper dive into how this works:\nExample: Chaining map and filter\n\nQuite elegant, isn't it? Let's break down the steps:\nStep-by-Step Breakdown\n\n\nCreating the Iterator:\n\nThis creates an iterator over the references to the elements of the vector numbers.\n\n\nMapping Values:\n\nThe map method creates a new iterator that applies the given closure to each item, in this case, squaring the values.\n\n\nFiltering Values:\n\nThe filter method creates another iterator that only yields items for which the given predicate is true, in this case, retaining even numbers.\n\n\nCollecting Results:\n\nThe collect method consumes the iterator and collects the resulting items into a new collection, in this case, a vector.\n\n\nHow It Works Internally\nEach method (map, filter, etc.) returns a new iterator type. For example:\n\nnumbers.iter() returns an Iter iterator.\nIter has a method map that returns a Map&lt;Iter, F&gt; iterator.\nMap&lt;Iter, F&gt; has a method filter that returns a Filter&lt;Map&lt;Iter, F&gt;, G&gt; iterator.\n\nThese iterator types (Iter, Map, Filter) all implement the Iterator trait, allowing them to be chained together seamlessly.\nIn Python we really like generators and lazy operations (meaning any computation is only done when needed). Rust iterators are also lazy by default, which can lead to significant performance improvements, especially when working with large collections.\n\nTraits are a fundamental feature in Rust that allow you to define shared behavior across different types. A trait is a collection of methods defined for an unknown type: Self. Traits can be implemented for any data type. In this case, the Iterator trait provides a common interface for all iterators, enabling method chaining.\nBy implementing the Iterator trait, a type gains the ability to be iterated over using methods like map, filter, and collect. This trait-based approach ensures that any type that implements Iterator can seamlessly integrate with Rust's powerful iterator combinators, promoting code reuse and modularity.\nA dedicated article to follow on this topic...\nBenefits of Chaining\n\nReadability: Method chaining provides a clear and concise way to express a series of operations on a collection.\nPerformance: Iterators in Rust are lazy and can be highly optimized by the compiler. Operations are performed only when needed.\nExtensibility: By implementing the Iterator trait for custom types, you can leverage all the powerful methods available on iterators.\n\nConclusion\nSo what are Python's robust and performant built-ins in Rust? You'll often find them as methods on iterator types, allowing you to chain operations together in a fluent and efficient manner. 😍 📈\nI hope this comparison has given you a better understanding of how Rust's method chaining with iterators can be a powerful tool in your programming arsenal.

If you want to keep the aspect ratio you can use the resize method instead of resize_exact:\n\nThat leads to an image of 200x150 in my case which looks better:\n\n  \n  \n    \n    \n  \n  \n\nPutting it all together:\n\nNote that because we're using the ? operator we need to update the return type of our function to Result&lt;(), ImageError&gt;.\nThe repo has some other interesting things:\n\n\nI use clap to parse command line arguments, see also this article.\n\n\nI use img.save_with_format(output_path, ImageFormat::Png)?; to save the image in a different format (ChatGPT gave me webp fake images so I converted them to png).\n\n\nIt uses glob (similar to Python's glob) with a pattern (\"{}/*{}\") to find all files in a directory with a certain extension, which can be provided as an argument to the program.\n\n\nI use the match statement to handle errors and print messages to the console in various places.\n\n\nConclusion\nThere you go, a quick way to resize images in Rust.\nThe image crate is powerful and easy to use, similar to Pillow in Python. 😍 📈\nYou can use the resize method to keep the aspect ratio or resize_exact to resize to an exact width and height.\nAgain, the full code of this mini project is here.\n","id":"https://rsbit.es/resizing-images/","title":"How to resize images in Rust"},"https://rsbit.es/rust-analyzer-ale-errors-while-coding/":{"body":"The more advanced you become as a developer the more you realize that the speed of coding is not just about language syntax or typing, it's as much about the tools and techniques you use.\nOne of my best Python coding setup tweaks has been showing errors upon saving files, for which I use this plugin. This speeds up development significantly! 😍 📈\nI wanted to do the same for Rust coding, specially because there is, compared to Python, an extra compilation step in Rust.\nIn this article I'll show you how I have set it up ...\nNote that I use Vim as my text editor and Mac as my operating system. I hope most of the setup is easily transferable to other text editors and operating systems. Or that at least it gets you thinking about how you can speed up your coding workflow. 💡\nInstall rust-analyzer\nFirst, you need to install rust-analyzer. I did this with brew:\n\nInstall ALE, the Asynchronous Lint Engine\nI use Vundle as my Vim plugin manager so I added this plugin to my .vimrc:\n\nAnd installed it with:\n\nSetup in .vimrc\nI added the following code to my .vimrc. I learned I can use ALE for Python as well in one go :)\n\n\n\nThe ale_linters variable is set to use rust-analyzer for Rust files and pyflakes for Python files. I installed pyflakes with pipx. By the way, this might become a replacement for the Python plugin I mentioned in the beginning, not sure yet ...\n\n\nThe ale_lint_on_save variable is set to 1 to check the syntax on save.\n\n\nThe ale_rust_analyzer_executable variable is set to rust-analyzer to ensure that rust-analyzer is installed and in your PATH.\n\n\nThe ale_lint_on_text_changed, ale_lint_on_insert_leave, and ale_lint_on_enter variables are set to never, 0, and 0 respectively to prevent linting on text changed, insert leave, and enter. Tweak these settings as you see fit.\n\n\nPlaying around with this plugin I added some more settings to my .vimrc:\n\nSee it in action\nHere is some code to try this on:\n\nLet's make a couple of errors and see the ALE checker in action 💡 🚀\n\nchanging mod data; to mod data\n\n\n\ndata to data2 which is not defined\n\n\n\nremoving a use statement\n\n\n\nremoving the #[tokio::main] attribute\n\n\n\nremoving the async keyword\n\n\nSpecially the ale_open_list and ale_set_quickfix settings are useful. The quickfix panel shows all the errors in a separate window, which is useful when you have mulitple errors that wrap in the editor window. For example:\n\n  \n  \n    \n    \n  \n  \n\nAnd it also works for Python 😎 🎉\n\nAnd:\n\nComplementing with GitHub Copilot\nIf an error is not 100% you can always add a \"question comment\" like this to get more suggestions. Here for example I purposely removed the await method from the fetch_data function:\n\nGitHub Copilot will suggest the following answer right below the question:\n\nThis is a useful technique and faster, because I can stay in Vim rather than making the round trip to ChatGPT. 🤖 🚀\n\nHope this helps you speed up your Rust coding! 🦀\nEither as a Vim user or not, you can use the same principle to speed up your coding in your favorite text editor.\nOr at least get into the mindset of speeding up your coding through efficient tools and techniques. 💪 📈\nIf you want to learn more about my Vim setup overall, check out this video: Supercharge Your Vim Workflow: Essential Tips and Plugins for Efficiency. 🎥 🚀\n","id":"https://rsbit.es/rust-analyzer-ale-errors-while-coding/","title":"Use rust-analyzer + ALE to show errors as you code in Rust"},"https://rsbit.es/rust-in-python-pyo3-maturin/":{"body":"In this article I will show you how to run Rust code in Python using PyO3 + Maturin.\nPyO3 is a Rust library for building Python bindings and Maturin is a tool for building and publishing Python packages built with PyO3.\nHere is a quick overview of the steps we will follow:\n\n  \n  \n    \n    \n  \n  \n\nLet's do a quick demo to see how it works.\nCreate a new library\nFirst, let's create a new Rust library using Cargo:\n\nThis will create a new directory called sum_squares with the following structure:\n\nNext we update the Cargo.toml file to include the pyo3 dependency:\n\nWe also need the cdylib crate type to create a shared library that can be loaded by Python (so/.dylib/.dll files, .so for Unix, .dll for Windows).\nNext, we update the src/lib.rs file to include a simple function that sums the squares of two numbers:\n\nAt a high level:\n\nThe #[pyfunction] attribute is used to mark the function as a Python function.\nThe #[pymodule] attribute is used to mark the module as a Python module.\nThe m.add_function method is used to add the sum_of_squares function to the module.\nThe wrap_pyfunction! macro is used to wrap the Rust function in a Python function.\nThe Python and PyModule types are used to interact with the Python runtime.\n\nSome Rust syntax I am learning about:\n\nWe use the use statement to import the pyo3::prelude module, which contains common types and traits used in PyO3.\nThe sum_of_squares function calculates the sum of squares of numbers from 1 to n using the ..= operator (= is including the upper bound) to create a range and the map and sum methods to calculate the sum of squares,\nThe function receives a single argument n of type u64 and returns a single value of type u64. Unlike Python's optional type hints, Rust's type hints are mandatory.\nThe PyResult in the sum_squares function signature is the return type of functions that can return errors. This is needed because the add_function method can return an error. The ? operator is used to propagate the error if it occurs.\nThe Ok(()) expression is used to return a successful result. () is the unit type, which is similar to void in other languages.\n\nCreate a Python package\nFirst make a virtual environment, enable it, and install the maturin package:\n\nNormally you would run maturin init to create a new Python package, but in this case we already have a Cargo project, so we can skip this step.\nLet's build the Python package using Maturin:\n\nIt worked but I did get this warning:\n\nTo fix this error, I updated the function signature to use &amp;Bound&lt;'_, PyModule&gt; instead of &amp;PyModule:\n\nAfter that change, I ran maturin develop again and the warning was gone:\n\nI can now see the shared library (.so file) in my virtual environment:\n\nAnd I can import it in the Python REPL:\n\nThat's it! We have successfully built a Python package with Rust code using PyO3 and Maturin.\nI have not pushed one to PyPI, but you can do that by running maturin publish. I will blog here when I have done that for a real project ...\nLastly, to see how it performs vs some Python code, I created a test.py file:\n\nRunning it:\n\nNice, the Rust implementation is about 3x faster than the Python implementation. But that's not the point of this article, the point is to show you how to run Rust code in Python which opens up exciting new opportunities for performance improvements in your Python code. 😍 📈\nThis is how Pydantic, the data validation library, is speeding up its codebase I believe. 😎\nConclusion\nIn this article, we learned how to run Rust code in Python using PyO3 and Maturin. We created a new Rust library with a simple function that sums the squares of two numbers, built a Python package using Maturin, and tested the performance of the Rust implementation against a Python implementation.\nThere is a lot more to learn about PyO3 and Maturin, and Rust in general.\nCheck out the PyO3 documentation and the Maturin documentation for more information.\nWhat Python code do you want to speed up with Rust?\n","id":"https://rsbit.es/rust-in-python-pyo3-maturin/","title":"How to run Rust in Python with PyO3 and Maturin"},"https://rsbit.es/rustlings-exercises-to-practice-rust/":{"body":"I have been going through the Rustlings exercises and I have found them to be a great way to practice Rust. 🔥\nAs I said in a previous post, it's all about pratice. 💡\nRust is also a language that requires some time to get used to, specially when coming from a dynamic language like Python. All of a sudden you have to get used to the strictness of the compiler and the ownership system.\nReading books like The Rust Programming Language and Programming Rust 2nd ed (both fantastic!), a lot might not stick until you put it into practice, there is a lot to take in!\nThat's where Rustlings comes in. It's a set of small exercises that you can work through to reinforce what you've learned.\nNot only will you write and fix code, you'll also read a lot of code forcing yourself to understand what it does.\nAnd you'll get to see a lot of compiler error messages in the process. Rust is strict and unforgiving so the sooner you get used to that the better.\nHow it works\nJust follow the README, the only thing I had to do on my Mac was:\n\nAnd then cd into the rustlings directory.\nWatch mode\nThere are various ways you can do the exercises, but I really liked this workflow:\n\n\nIn the first terminal window, run rustlings watch.\n\n\nIn the second terminal window, open the exercises directory in your favorite editor (in my case Vim + fzf for quick file search) and start coding, as soon as you save a file, watch will pick it up and the corresponding tests will run.\n\n\nToggling between the two terminal windows writing code + seeing the tests run + reading the error messages, felt like learning on steroids. 💪\nConclusion\nI'm through ~80% of the 96 exercises and I can say that I've learned a lot: ownership, borrowing, lifetimes, pattern matching, enums, structs, traits, generics, iterators, error handling, writing tests, it's all there! 🚀\nI highly recommend giving it a go, it's a great tool to really solidify what you've learned from reading books and watching videos. You might be surprised how little actually has stuck from any passive learning you've done. 🤯\nThis effective learning also happens when you try to build smaller projects, but Rustlings is a great way to reinforce the basics and fundamental concepts. 📈\n","id":"https://rsbit.es/rustlings-exercises-to-practice-rust/","title":"Rustlings 😍 - Small exercises to get you used to reading + writing Rust 🦀"},"https://rsbit.es/shipped-first-crate/":{"body":"In the previous post, I made a little Rust script to search Pybites content. In this post I share how I deployed this crate (the Rust term for a package) to crates.io (the Rust package index). 🎉\nNext I will show you how I streamlined it using GitHub Actions. 🚀\nSetup\nFirst you need to make an account on crates.io, confirm your email, and create an API token. You can find this under your account settings.\nNext you login from the command line:\n\nPublishing\nThen you can publish your crate, from your project directory:\n\nIt takes the version from your Cargo.toml file. If you want to publish a new version, you need to update this file.\nInstalling the crate\nAs a user you can now install your crate:\n\nI added a [[bin]] section to my Cargo.toml file, so the binary is installed as psearch:\n\nNow when people install the crate, they can run psearch from the command line. 🏃\n\nAutomating with GitHub Actions\nOf course manually pushing to crates.io is not ideal. You can automate this with GitHub Actions. Here is the workflow I use:\n\nThis workflow triggers on a tag push, so you can tag your releases with vX.Y.Z and it will automatically publish your crate to crates.io (when you do a git push --tags) 🏷️\n2 simple steps to publish your crate:\n\nUpdate your Cargo.toml file with the new version.\nTag your release with vX.Y.Z and push it to GitHub: git tag v0.2.0 &amp;&amp; git push --tags\n\nAlso note that you'll need the CARGO_REGISTRY_TOKEN secret for this workflow to work. You can add this in your GitHub repository settings under Settings -&gt; Secrets -&gt; New repository secret. 🤫\nJob run example.\n\nThat's it!

In Rust, you can use the #[cfg(test)] and #[test] attributes to write tests. Let's explore how ...\nWriting a test\nTo get some boilerplace code, make a library project with cargo new mylib --lib and you get this:\n\n\n\n#[cfg(test)] is a conditional compilation attribute that tells the compiler to only compile the module when running tests.\n\n\nmod tests is a module that contains all the tests.\n\n\nuse super::*; imports all the functions from the parent module.\n\n\n#[test] is an attribute that tells the compiler that the function is a test, you prepend it to each test function.\n\n\nassert_eq! is a macro that checks if the two arguments are equal.\n\n\nThat's it. Now you can run cargo test to run the tests. If you want to run a specific test, you can run cargo test it_works (similar to pytest -k).\nWriting some tests for my CLI alarm project\nThis both a good and bad project to demo this. Bad because it uses system audio which is hard to test. Good because it's a simple project and has one function I am interested in testing for this article.\nHere is the code:\n\nCopying above boilerplace over I got to write these tests:\n\nI could have grouped them all into one test, but I wanted:\n\nTo show how you can write multiple tests.\nTo have better naming for each test for readability and targeting.\n\nOn the other hand having a test function for each test would be way too verbose.\nUnfortunately there is no parametrize feature in Rust like in pytest, so this was my \"workaround\" for now.\nRunning cargo test I get:\n\nUnittest vs integration tests\nThis has been an example of a unit test: a test that tests a single piece of code, often a single function.\nYou can also write integration tests in Rust. Integration tests are tests that test the interaction between multiple modules or components.\nYou can write integration tests in a tests directory, I will show here when I cross that bridge ...\nConclusion\nThe #[cfg(test)] attribute is a conditional compilation attribute that instructs the Rust compiler to only compile the annotated module when running tests.\nWithin this module, the #[test] attribute is used to mark functions as tests, and the assert_eq! macro is employed to check if two values are equal.\nIt is common practice to bundle unit tests within the same module as the code being tested. Integration tests, however, are typically placed in a dedicated module within the tests directory.\nRust does not have a built-in parametrize feature like pytest. To manage multiple test cases, you can either write individual test functions for each case or group similar tests within a few functions to improve naming and targeting options.\n","id":"https://rsbit.es/testing-in-rust/","title":"How to write unit tests in Rust"},"https://rsbit.es/tts-in-rust/":{"body":"I tweaked my alarm clock app today to add text-to-speech (TTS).\nI started with the obvious choice: tts crate, but it did not work on my Mac, no audio.\nAdding text-to-speech\nSo I got a bit creative and ended up with this function:\n\n\n\nOn macOS, it uses the say command (built-in / ships by default with macOS). For Windows, it uses PowerShell to speak the message. And on Linux, it uses espeak. Note that I mostly care about a Mac solution right now, so I have not tested the Windows + Linux ones yet ...\n\n\ncfg!(target_os = \"...\") is a Rust macro that checks the target operating system (similar how you can use the platform module in Python). It is a compile-time check, so the code for other operating systems will not be included in the binary.\n\n\nThe expect method is used to panic if the command fails. I probably should handle the error more gracefully, I will improve this later.\n\n\nprintln! prints to standard output. To print to standard error, you can use eprintln! and it's good practice to use it for error messages.\n\n\nThe return type is Result&lt;(), Box&lt;dyn std::error::Error&gt;&gt; to indicate that the function can return an error. The Box&lt;dyn std::error::Error&gt; is a trait object that can hold any type that implements the Error trait. I am seeing this pattern quite a bit in Rust code.\n\n\nNew command-line arguments\nThe message to speak is a new (Clap) command-line argument:\n\nAnd I play it a couple of times, another new command-line argument:\n\nI added this loop to play the message multiple times:\n\nThe nice thing about usize (and typing in general) is that it excludes invalid options.\nFor example, if the user enters a negative number, the program will not compile. The usize type is an unsigned integer, meaning that it cannot be negative.\nRanges in Rust (vs Python)\nThe 0..N construct is similar to range in Python, where the upper bound is also exclusive. Also in both languages, the lower bound is inclusive. To make the upper bound inclusive, you can use 0..=N in Rust. So I could also write 1..=args.times to play the message args.times times.\nYou can also use std::iter::repeat here I learned:\n\nBut that seems more verbose and complicated than the more concise and readable for loop so I stuck with that.\nSo running the program like this it will say \"Wake up\" 3 times after 3 seconds:\n\nWhy 3 times? By not specifying the number of times, it will default to 3 (see the TIMES_TO_PLAY constant).\nConclusion\nI like the current 0.3.0 (available on crates.io) better than the previous ones, where I was playing an alarm file. This had the added complexity of downloading and playing an audio file.\nThe text-to-speech feature is less code relatively and actually tells the user what the alarm is about. The only thing is compatibility, I need to test it on Windows and Linux still ...\nAs usual, by building things I've learned more about interesting Rust features and idioms. I am also getting more comfortable with the language and its ecosystem. 😍 📈\nI will probably use this project to write some more posts about 1. code structuring (modularizing your code), 2. testing and 3. documentation.

I struggled with getting cargo test to work on AWS Lambda for a week (talking about tunnel vision), so it was time to pivot to a different approach.\nIt turns out that I needed a bit more resource power and Heroku did it for me. So I dropped AWS Gateway API + AWS Lambda (what we normally use to validate coding exercises) and wrote my first Rust API to run tests on code.\nThe final version is a bit more involved, because it gets the code from our platform's API.
