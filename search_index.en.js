have been having a blast learning Rust, now 25 days in a row! 🎉\nWhat has worked\n1. Start building ASAP\nDo a bit of initial study, but leave the theory soon and start building from day one (fake it before you make it).\nBack it up with reading/study, but code every day! Converting Pybites tools, originally written in Python, to Rust kept it fun for me.\n2. Use AI tools\nUse AI for both coding and explaining concepts.\nIt's like having a dedicated research assistant and is much faster than googling or using Stack Overflow. Combined with the first strategy, you are knee-deep in code quickly, which boosts your learning.\n3. Blog about your journey\nBlogging forces you to understand concepts more thoroughly and share your insights. The first strategy ensures you always have content to talk about, and using AI tools, like ChatGPT for research and Co-pilot for writing, you can do this faster and better.\nAdditionally, blogging regularly forces you to put content out there, which also helps with the impostor syndrome that often comes with learning something new. 💡\n4. Find an accountability partner\nFind someone who is further along with the language to guide and encourage you.\nA special shout-out to Jim Hodapp, who has been instrumental in clarifying doubts and supporting my journey.\nSome wins / takeaways\n1. Re-thinking things in Python\nRust’s emphasis on safety and correctness through its strict compiler checks and ownership system has highlighted the areas where Python’s flexibility could potentially lead to bugs and less maintainable code.\nFor example, with the Rust learning experience so far, I am even more eager to use type hints in Python or add stricter validation with Pydantic. These tools add a layer of safety and correctness to Python code, which learning Rust made me more aware of and appreciate more.\nSimilarly, Rust's default immutability makes you reflect on what that can mean for your Python code. It has made me more aware of the potential risks and benefits of mutable data structures, encouraging me to adopt immutability in Python where possible to enhance code safety and maintainability.\nSo a side effect of learning Rust is that I will become a better Python programmer. 🐍\n2. Learning Rust is a journey - it's hard, but rewarding\nRust is a complex language, and the learning curve is steep. But the challenge is what makes it fun and rewarding. 🚀\nI think the most important thing is to not take it all in at once. Break it down into small, manageable chunks, and build something at every step, even if it's small. 💡\nThen gradually expose yourself to more advanced concepts, but be realistic with your timelines.\nI have been mostly doing scripting so far and that's fine, at least I got quite some code written, and even shipped.\nAnd there is something special about the compiler. 😍 It's strict and unforgiving, but it also becomes your best friend.\nThe feeling of accomplishment when you get the code to compile and run is awesome, specially knowing that that code is probably safe and performant. 🎉\n3. Adding an amazing tool to my toolbox\nRust's performance capabilities are impressive. Even though I haven't delved deeply into this aspect yet, I did learn how to integrate Rust into Python.\nSo when I need to write performance-critical code, I can now try to use Rust and integrate it with Python.\n4. Reaffirming the Pybites trifecta\nThe combination of \"building - JIT learning - putting content out\" works beyond Python. It turns out to be an effective template to learn any new language or technology. 😎\nConclusion\nLearning Rust has been useful on many levels, but it's easy to get into tutorial paralysis when learning a new language.\nSo by building concrete tools, using AI, blogging, and finding an accountability partner, I have been able to keep the learning fun and productive. 🚀\nI am only 25 days in, and I have a long way to go. But I am excited to see where this journey takes me over time ... 📈\n","id":"https://rsbit.es/25-days-learning-rust-takeaways/","title":"25 days of learning Rust: what worked + takeaways"},"https://rsbit.es/adding-auth-to-an-api/":{"body":"Our exercise downloader started as a simple tool that fetched free exercises from an API.\nWhen we added premium exercises behind authentication this week, I needed to add API key support — without breaking the free tier experience.\nThe Design\nThe requirements were straightforward:\n\nNo API key?

Just an env var.\nReading the Key\n\nenv::var returns Result&lt;String, VarError&gt;. Calling .ok() converts it to Option&lt;String&gt; — Some(\"the-key\") if set, None if not. No error handling needed because a missing key is a valid state, not an error.\nComing from Python where you'd write os.environ.get(\"KEY\") and get None back, I found this two-step dance surprising at first. But it makes sense — Rust forces you to acknowledge that reading an env var can fail, then lets you explicitly opt into treating \"missing\" as None (related exercise: Option Handling).\nConditional Header\nThe build_request function attaches the header only when a key exists:\n\nThe function takes Option&lt;&amp;str&gt; rather than Option&lt;String&gt; — the caller passes api_key.as_deref() to borrow rather than move the value. This keeps ownership with main() so the key can be used elsewhere (like in status messages).\nI initially passed Option&lt;String&gt; and hit a \"value used after move\" error. In Python you never think about this — everything is a reference. In Rust, I learned to reach for borrows (&amp;str) by default and only pass owned data when the function needs to keep it (learn about Ownership and Borrowing in our exercise track).\nUser Feedback\nA small touch that matters in CLIs: tell the user what mode they're in.\n\nThe message includes the env var name so users know exactly what to set if they want premium exercises.\nOne thing I learned here: idiomatic Rust prefers Option&lt;&amp;str&gt; over &amp;Option&lt;String&gt; in function signatures (clippy will even flag it). A cleaner version would be:\n\nThe caller would pass api_key.as_deref() — the same pattern we used in build_request.\nTesting Without a Server\nI learned that you don't need to make HTTP requests to test request construction. Build the request, inspect it:\n\nRequestBuilder::build() gives you the final Request object without sending it. You can assert on URL, method, headers — everything except the actual response.\nKey Takeaways\n\nUse env::var(\"KEY\").ok() to get an Option&lt;String&gt; — missing env vars aren't errors when they're optional\nOption&lt;&amp;str&gt; in function signatures avoids unnecessary ownership transfer\nRequestBuilder::build() lets you test HTTP request construction without making network calls\nAlways tell the user what mode the CLI is operating in\n\nThe Open Source Side\nThis feature came out of iterating on the tool together with Giuseppe Cunsolo, who originally built the CLI downloader. We added the auth support, full test coverage, and a CI gate that fails below 80% coverage (using tarpaulin). Then we published it to crates.io so you can install it with a single command instead of cloning a repo.\nIt reminded me how much you learn from open source collaboration — and how nice the Rust tooling is (no wonder uv got its inspiration from Cargo).\nTry It Yourself\nIf you have a CLI that talks to an API, try adding optional authentication. The pattern is always the same: env var to Option, conditional header, clear status message.\n\nIf you're a Pythonista curious about Rust, you'll feel right at home — Option is like Python's Optional, pattern matching replaces your if/else chains, and Cargo works like the beloved uv. Our exercises at rustplatform.com are designed with that Python-to-Rust bridging in mind.\nUse the exercise downloader to code locally — it's a real-world Rust CLI you can learn from too:\n\nHappy coding!\n","id":"https://rsbit.es/adding-auth-to-an-api/","title":"Adding API Key Authentication to a Rust CLI"},"https://rsbit.es/automating-test-runs-and-checking-coverage/":{"body":"The other day I did a post on testing in Rust and the next logical step is to automate test runs and check coverage.

It is written in Rust and uses the Tera template engine, which is similar to Jinja2, Django templates, Liquid, and Twig. source\n\nInstallation\n\nMaybe something more but these were the main steps.\nConfiguration\nThis is my config.toml:\n\n\nbase_url is important for the theme to work correctly (I forgot to update https://example.com at the start and it broke the theme's styling)\ntheme is the name of the theme folder in themes/\ncompile_sass - Sass compilation is required (see theme docs)\nthe settings under [extra] are theme specific.\n\nWriting\nFor each new post, you create a new markdown file in the content folder. The file name should be the title of the post with dashes instead of spaces.\nThe file should start with a TOML front matter block, which is the metadata for the post. Here is an example:\n\nIf you want to add more metadata, you can add it in this front matter block. If you don't want to publish the post yet, you can add draft = true for example.\nThen write the content in markdown beneath this block.\nTo make a new post I made a quick shell script:\n\nBuilding\n\nThis will generate the static site in the public folder.\nThen run a local server to preview the site:\n\nFor convenience I made a Makefile with some aliases including a combined dev command:\n\ncheckout-theme I added later when I git clone'd this repo on a new machine and detected that the theme repo was not cloned automatically.\nDeployment\nI use GitHub Actions to build and deploy the site (so nice!)\nHere is the workflow file (.github/workflows/deploy.yml):\n\nThis workflow will build the site and push the changes to the gh-pages branch upon every push to the main branch.\n\n\nInterestingly ChatGPT overcomplicated this, but I found in Zola's docs that you can actually use shalzz/zola-deploy-action. I only had to update from 0.17.x to 0.18.x to make it work.\n\n\nYou don't have to setup the secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN as it is a default secret provided by GitHub if you use your action for the same repository.\n\n\nI did have to update the \"Workflow permissions\" under GitHub's repo Settings &gt; Actions, to enable \"Read and write permissions\" (Workflows have read and write permissions in the repository for all scopes.), otherwise the action would fail.\n\n\nI also had to set \"Build and deployment\" to \"Deploy form a branch\" (under Settings &gt; Pages) and set the branch to gh-pages + / (root).\n\n\nStatic files\nI did hit one issue when showing images in the post.\nI thought this would work:\n\nHaving the image in my static/ folder, but it didn't show up on the live site.\nI played with the path making it relative and absolute, but in the end, I had to use the image() shortcode with the src attribute pointing to the image in the static/ folder (just the file name, not the full path). See theme docs as well.\nAdd pages\nThis was a bit less straight-forward so I am adding it here as an extra. See commit:\n\nI created a menu_items array in the config.toml with the pages I wanted to add to the menu.\nI created a content/pages folder and added a markdown file for each page using existing templates from the theme (about and archive).\nI also made an content/pages/_index.md, I cannot 100% remember but I think it would not compile without it.\nI could move the post entries to a new content/posts folder (and use the content/posts/_index.md to list the posts), but I decided to keep them in the root content folder for now.\n\nOK that seems easier than it was, but I had to try a few things to get it right. 😅\nAdd search\nYou can enable search in the theme by setting build_search_index = true in the config.toml. This will generate search_index.json and elasticlunr.min.js files in the public folder upon build.\nelasticlunr.js is a lightweight full-text search engine in JavaScript for browser search. The search index is generated from the content of the site upon build, the index is stored in mentioned search_index.json file.\nHere is the commit I made to get search working on this site:\n\n\nI created a templates/search.html file with the search form and results.\n\n\nIt contains the necessary JavaScript to make this work. First we define an idx constant: const idx = elasticlunr.Index.load(window.searchIndex); which we can then use to search the index (idx.search(query)). It returns an array of search results which we then render in the DOM.\n\n\nI added some CSS to style the search results and added the page to the navigation menu with {name = \"Search\", url = \"$BASE_URL/pages/search\"}, in the config.toml.\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    \n    \n  \n  \n\n\n  \n  \n    \n    \n  \n  \n\nAdd a custom domain\nApart from mentioned base_url in the config.toml, you also need to add a CNAME file in the static/ folder with the domain you want to use, e.g.:\n\nThen under the repo's Settings &gt; GitHub Pages, you can add the custom domain. You can also turn on HTTPS there.\nLastly you need to update your DNS settings of your domain provider to point to GitHub's IP addresses, see GitHub's docs.\nConclusion\nZola is a great SSG so far, I am happy with the setup. I like the simplicity of the tool and the speed of the generated site (Rust 📈 -&gt; zola build -&gt; Done in 91ms. for me) and automatic deployment with GitHub Actions. 😍\nIf you're looking for a Rust based SSG solution I hope this post will help you with the setup. 📈\n","id":"https://rsbit.es/blog-with-zola/","title":"How to blog with Zola, a Rust-based static site generator"},"https://rsbit.es/building-website-axum/":{"body":"I managed to make a website using Axum, a web framework for Rust, pretty similar to Flask in its minimalistic approach. Although it's a basic site, I'm happy with the result, and I learned a lot in the process.\n\n  \n  \n    \n    \n  \n  \n\nIn this post, I'll show you how I built a simple artist portfolio site using this framework.\nSetup\n\nI added the following dependencies:\n\nThe code\nFirst I created the main file, src/main.rs, which contains the application setup and the routes.\nThe repo is here.\n\n\nThe handlers module contains the request handlers for the different routes.\nThe s3 module contains the logic to interact with AWS S3 (I ended up simplifying this part for now, see in a bit).\nThe Config struct holds the configuration for the application (the AWS S3 bucket name holding the images). I'm using the Arc type to share this configuration across the application.\nThe dotenv crate is used to load environment variables from a .env file, see this article. I added an .env-template file in the repo to show you what variables you need to set.\nThe tracing and tracing-subscriber crates are used for logging.\nThe tower-http crate is used to serve static files from the static directory, which I happily got working for this app too.\nThe askama crate is used for templating, which I'll show that in the handlers section.\nThe tokio crate is used for async I/O.\nThe axum crate is the web framework itself and serves the application.\n\nCreating the handlers\n\n\nThe handlers module contains the request handlers for the different routes.\nThe askama crate is used for templating. I created two templates, about.html and portfolio.html, which are rendered by the handlers.\nThe about_handler function renders the about.html template, passing the image URL and the current page name, which I use to highlight the current page in the navigation bar.\nThe portfolio_handler function renders the portfolio.html template, passing a list of image URLs and the current page name.\nThe s3::get_images function is a placeholder for now, returning a HashMap of image URLs from the S3 bucket. I'll show you how I implemented this function in the next section. I did have to convert the HashMap to a Vec of tuples to get the template to work, as I couldn't get it to work with a HashMap directly.\n\nRetrieving images from AWS S3\n\n\nThe s3 module contains the logic to interact with AWS S3. I had this working at some point with the rusoto* crates, but I ended up simplifying it for this first iteration (old s3 code still here).\nFor now I am just returning a HashMap of image full + thumb URLs, but in a real-world scenario, you might fetch the images from a bucket (and only a few per request using pagination).\nI used ChatGPT to make some nice artist work images and made another Rust script to resize them (will post it soon here ...)\n\nTemplates and static files\nI'm using the askama crate for templating. I created two templates, about.html and portfolio.html, which extend a base.html template. The about.html template contains some fake text about the artist, and the portfolio.html template displays a list of images.\n\nThis is the portfolio.html template:\n\nNote here I only managed to loop through a Vec of tuples, not a HashMap directly, so I had to convert the HashMap to a Vec of tuples in the handler (see above).\nI also added some CSS classes to the images and lightbox to make them look nice (you can find the CSS here). This is why you see a loop.index in the template, which is used to generate unique IDs for the lightbox.\nAnd finally, the base.html template:\n\nI like that apart from templating (and inheritance with them), I got static files to work so I could add a style.css file to style the page.\nThe static folder is served by the tower-http crate, which I added to the Router in the main file. It can also serve other static files like images, fonts, etc.\nAs mentioned before I also check each navigation item to see if it's the current page, and if so I add the active class to highlight it in the navigation bar.\nConclusion and next steps\nI managed to build a simple artist portfolio site using Axum, a web framework for Rust. It's still a basic site, but I'm happy with the result so far 🚀\nOf course I heavily used ChatGPT to get this working, but I learned so much faster this way, libraries like Axum and Askama make most sense when you start to use them in the context of a project.\nJust reading about them won't get you anywhere near being able to use them effectively. There's still a lot to learn, but this gave me some good basic insights how to build a website with Rust. 💡\nAgain you can find the code in the repo.\n\nI want to further explore how to interact with AWS S3, and I want to learn how to add a contact form to also handle form data and send emails. 📈\nI also managed to deploy the site to Heroku, which I'll discuss soon here, it was really easy to do. 😍\nWhat will you build with Axum?

It's best practice to print the error message to stderr (using eprintln) and exit the script with a non-zero status code (Unix convention).\nI used the regex crate to make a regex pattern from the search terms. I had to escape the search terms because they could contain special characters. I used the regex::escape function for this.\nI needed the as_deref method to convert the Option&lt;String&gt; to an Option&lt;&amp;str&gt;.

Your IDE might also proactively warn you about it.\nOverall type hints are a good practice in Python, they make your code more readable and bring some of Rust's strictness to Python. 💡 😍 📈\nAnother example of enforcing immutability in Python is using frozen=True on a dataclass.\nNow let's look at Rust. You define constants using the const keyword and define the type explicitly:\n\nThe &amp;str type is a reference to a string, which avoids copying data around. In contrast, String is a heap-allocated string.\n&amp;str does not allocate memory itself; it references an existing string slice. This is more efficient for passing around string literals, which are stored in the program's binary and are immutable, making &amp;str ideal for constants.\nThe key point is that you cannot override these values; the compiler will raise an error.\nRust also has a static keyword which is used for global variables, but that's a topic for another article.\nIn both Python and Rust, you can define enums to group related constants together, but that's a topic for another article too.\nPractice This\nTry the Variables and Mutability exercise on the Pybites Rust Platform to practice let, mut, and const in Rust.\nConclusion\nBoth Python and Rust have clear conventions for defining constants.

Config section you want to separate config from code:\n\nApps sometimes store config as constants in the code. This is a violation of twelve-factor, which requires strict separation of config from code.\n\nSee The twelve-factor app - III. Config for more details.\nBasically, you want to be able to make config changes independently from code changes. 💡\nWe also want to hide secret keys and API credentials! Notice that git is very persistent (see this PyCon talk for example) so it’s important to get this right from the start.\nLoading environment variables in Rust\nYou can load in environment variables like this in Rust:\n\nBut that requires you to set the environment variables before running your program (export MY_VAR=my_value from the command line). This is not ideal for production code and even for local development, it can be cumbersome.\nIt's common to keep a local .env file with your environment variables (don't forget to add this file to your .gitignore!)\nUsing the dotenv crate 📈\nResearching how you can do this in Rust, I stumbled upon the dotenv crate, which makes handling environment variables straightforward.\nFirst, add the crate to your Cargo.toml:\n\nSecondly, you create an .env file in the root of your project:\n\nAgain it’s important that you ignore this file with git, otherwise, you might end up committing sensitive data to your repo/project. 😱\nIgnoring .env in git\nNot sure what the Rust standard is, a standard Rust .gitignore file does not include the .env pattern, Python's one does.\nWhat I usually do (in Python) is commit an empty .env-example (or .env-template) file so other developers know what they should set.\nSo a new developer (or me checking out the repo on another machine) can do a cp .env-template .env and populate the variables. As the (checked out) .gitignore file contains .env, git won’t show it as a file to be staged for commit.\nExample using dotenv\nTo load in the variables from this file, we use a few lines of code:\n\n\ndotenv().ok() loads the environment variables from the .env file.\n.expect is used to handle the case where the environment variable is not set.\n\nWith this setup, you can now access your environment variables using env::var:\n\nThis is because we didn't set the environment variables yet in .env, doing so:\n\nNow it works as expected 🎉\n\nThis is actually pretty similar to Python using the python-dotenv library. 🐍\n\nFor boolean values, a common requirement for configuration settings like DEBUG, you can use env::var and parse the string to a boolean like this:\n\n\nThis works when setting DEBUG=true or DEBUG=false in your .env file.\n.map is used to convert the string to a boolean.\nThe final unwrap_or is used to handle the case where the environment variable is not set or contains an invalid value.\n\nPractice This\nThe .map and .unwrap_or patterns used in this post are core to working with Option in Rust.

It led to some exception handling code, which I found interesting to compare with Python.\nAdding exception to running an external command\nHere is an example of exception handling I added to my lambda function to run a cargo command in a temporary directory. The function returns the output of the command if it is successful, or an error message if it fails:\n\nHere is the equivalent code in Python:\n\nRust and Python Error Handling Comparison\n\n\nIn Rust, we use the Result type (Ok/Err) to represent success or failure, while in Python, we use exceptions.\n\n\nRust requires explicit handling of both success and failure cases, while Python allows for more flexible error handling.\n\n\nRust's error handling is enforced at compile time, while Python's error handling is checked at runtime.\n\n\nRust's pattern matching allows for concise and clear error handling, while Python's exception handling requires less boilerplate, it's more flexible, but can also lead to more runtime errors (because they are detected later).\n\n\nIn Python you have to specifically catch the FileNotFoundError exception (and fall back to a generic Exception), while in Rust, it is handled by the Err case of the match statement which could include any error that occurs during the execution of the command.\n\n\nPractice This\nPractice error handling on the Pybites Rust Platform:\n\nResult Handling\nCustom Error Types\n\nConclusion\nPython's exception handling allows for rapid and flexible development, making it easier to write code quickly. However, this same flexibility can lead to more runtime errors because errors are often detected later (at runtime) and it's easier to overlook proper error handling.\nRust, on the other hand, enforces more rigorous error handling at compile time, leading to more reliable and predictable code, though it can be more verbose and require more upfront effort.\nThis is just a small example, when I get into more nuances of error handling in Rust, I will follow up with a more detailed post. I also understand there are some common crates you can use like anyhow to make error handling in Rust more concise and flexible.

Turning your code into the latter is useful when you want to reuse the code in the script in other projects.\nCompare it to a script vs a package in Python. In Python you can write a script and then turn it into a package by adding an __init__.py file. In Rust you can write a script and then turn it into a library by moving the code into a library project. Let's see how to do this ...\nWriting a script\nLet's start by writing the simplest script that prints a greeting to the console. And a main function that calls the hello function with a name:\nCreate a new project called project:\n\nAnd edit the src/main.rs file to contain the following code:\n\nThis script defines a hello function that takes a name as an argument and prints a greeting to the console. The main function calls the hello function with the name \"Alice\" (no command line arguments, this is for example's sake).\nTurning the script into a library\nTo turn the script into a library, we need to create a new library project and move the code from the script into the library. We can do this by running the following commands:\n\nThe --lib flag tells Cargo to create a library project instead of a binary project.\nThis will create a new library project called my_library and move the code from the script into the library. The lib.rs file is the entry point for the library, and it contains the code that will be executed when the library is used.\nUsing the library\nTo use the library in the first project, we need to add it as a dependency in the Cargo.toml file of the project. We can do this by adding the following line to the Cargo.toml file of the project:\n\nNormally you would list one or more crates from crates.io in the dependencies section, but in this case we are using a relative path to the library project.\nWe can now use the library in the project by importing it and calling the hello function. Create main.rs again (it was previously moved to the library) under src in the project and add the following code to it:\n\nThe path works, because ALE complains about the next thing:\n\nRust makes functions private by default. So back in the library I need to make the function public explicitly by adding pub in front of it in lib.rs:\n\nAnd then it works:\n\nI do get this warning that the main function in the library is never used, which makes sense, because unlike a binary project, the library is not an executable. Therefor I can remove the main function from the library, no more warnings:\n\nSimilar to Python where you can do import pathlib as well as from pathlib import Path, you can do the same in Rust. You can import the whole library with use my_library; or just the hello function with use my_library::hello;.\n\nAnd that'll work equally well.\nSometimes people opt for the first option, because it's more explicit where the function comes from (my_library::hello vs hello). But in this case it's a bit overkill, because there's only one function in the library.\nPractice This\nPractice modules and visibility on the Pybites Rust Platform:\n\nModule Basics\nVisibility Rules\nUse and Paths\n\nConclusion\nWe learned how to make a library as opposed to a script (binary) in Rust (which is what I have mostly done up until this point). This is useful when you want to reuse the code in the script in other projects.\nWe also learned how to use the library in another project and the fact that Rust makes module functions private by default (another example where it's more strict than Python!)\nThis is a good thing because it forces you to think about what you want to expose to the outside world.\nWe also learned about the two ways to import functions from a library: importing the whole library or just the function you need. And lastly the fact that libraries don't have a main function, because they are not executables.\nNow you know how to write libraries in Rust so you can write code that is easier to reuse and maintain. 😍 🎉 📈\n","id":"https://rsbit.es/from-script-to-library-in-rust/","title":"From script to library in Rust"},"https://rsbit.es/linting-with-clippy/":{"body":"In Python you often use flake8, pyflakes and/or ruff to lint your code.

However, I've been hearing a lot about Rust lately and wanted to explore it further. Rust is known for its performance, safety, and concurrency support, things I have not learned much about so far and are fascinating.\nPopular projects in the Python space that leverage Rust include Pydantic and Ruff. We recently had Samuel Colvin (creator of Pydantic) on our Pybites podcast and at Pycon 2024 I saw Charlie Marsh talk about how Rust makes Ruff so fast. This inspired me to dive into Rust.\nLearning Rust\nAs per our Pybites motto you have to build projects and share your learning to get the most benefit, hence this blog.\nOf course I will heavily use AI tools, most notably Co-Pilot and ChatGPT to help me learn and write Rust code. I will also share how this process goes ...\nAnd lastly shout-out to Jim Hodapp who has a community called Rust Never Sleeps.

If you want mutability, you have to explicitly make them mutable. We'll see how to do that in the Rust in a bit ...\nRust offers structs\nIn Rust, you can use a struct with named fields to create the same Person type as before. Here's how you can do it:\n\nThis prints:\n\n(Ommitting the cargo run command from here on.)\nNotice that if I uncomment the line person.age = 31; the Rust compiler will complain. I am really impressed by with how helpful the Rust compiler is. It gives you very helpful and specific error messages. Here's what it says in this case:\n\nSo as per the error message, you can make the struct mutable by adding the mut keyword before the variable name:\n\nThis works and prints:\n\nImplement methods\nOptionally you can implement methods on the struct to make it more powerful. Here's an example:\n\nWhich prints:\n\nIn Rust, you can enhance your structs by implementing methods using the impl block. This allows you to define functions that operate on instances of your struct, providing a cleaner and more encapsulated way to manage data + associated behaviors (think properties and methods in Python classes).\nThe greet(&amp;self) method is an instance method that takes an immutable reference to the struct (= &amp;self), similar to how Python methods take self as their first parameter. This method simply prints a greeting using the struct's fields.\nThe reference part here touches upon the concept of ownership and borrowing in Rust. Ownership is a big and important concept in Rust, and I'll cover it here more in detail when I have a better understanding of it ...\nPractice This\nTry the Basic Structs and Variables and Mutability exercises on the Pybites Rust Platform.\nConclusion\nIn Rust, you can use a struct with named fields to achieve the same thing as a Python namedtuple.\nStructs are immutable by default, but you can make them mutable by adding the mut keyword before the variable name.\nOptionally, you can implement methods on the struct using the impl block. 🦀😎\nI find the Rust compiler very helpful with its detailed and specific error messages. It helps a lot, specially when you're learning the language. 😍💡📈\n","id":"https://rsbit.es/namedtuple-in-rust-struct/","title":"Does Rust have a similar NamedTuple type?"},"https://rsbit.es/ownership-and-borrowing/":{"body":"In Python, this code runs just fine:\n\nWhen I pass person to print_person, the ownership of person is not moved to the function. I can still use person after the function call.\nIn Rust, the same code will not compile:\n\nThe Rust compiler gives this nicely descriptive error message:\n\nWhat happens here is that person is moved to print_person, and I can't use it after that. This is because Rust is strict about ownership and borrowing.\nThis definitely takes some time to get used to, but it's a powerful and important feature of Rust.\nIt helps prevent memory-related bugs (e.g., use-after-free, double-free, dangling pointers, memory leaks) that are common in other languages that manage memory manually (e.g., C and C++).\nThe solution is to borrow person instead of moving it:\n\nHere we pass a reference instead of the value itself. Note that you have to express this explicitly with &amp; in the function signature and when calling the function.\nIn Rust speak person is borrowed by print_person. This way the function can use person without taking ownership of it.\nKey Takeaways:\n\n\nIn Rust, passing ownership to a function means the original variable can no longer be used. This is to prevent multiple owners of the same data, which can lead to bugs and memory leaks. It also helps with performance and concurrency.\n\n\nIn Python, variables are references, so they remain valid after being passed to functions. Additionally, you don't have to worry about memory management because Python's garbage collector automatically handles the allocation and deallocation of memory (it tracks object references and uses reference counting and cyclic garbage collection to free memory that is no longer needed).\n\n\nRust's borrowing allows you to pass references to functions without transferring ownership, preserving the original variable’s validity.\n\n\nMutability and borrowing\nIn Rust, you can have multiple immutable references to the same data, but only one mutable reference. Additionally, you have to explicitly declare that you want to mutate the data.\nIn Python, the burden is on the programmer to ensure that data is not modified when it shouldn't be. Python doesn't distinguish between mutable and immutable references explicitly.\n\nFor example here my_list is modified inside modify_data function. In Rust, this would not compile because my_list is borrowed immutably by modify_data:\n\nThe Rust compiler will give this error:\n\nIn Rust, to modify data within a function, you must pass a mutable reference using &amp;mut. This ensures that only one mutable reference exists at a time, preventing data races and ensuring memory safety.\n\nNote: This is for example's sake. I don't like mutating outer scope data inside functions. A more functional approach would be to return the modified data.\nPractice This\nPractice these concepts on the Pybites Rust Platform:\n\nOwnership and Borrowing\nMove Semantics\nShared References\nMutable References\n\nConclusion\nUnderstanding ownership and borrowing is a key concept in Rust. It can be frustrating at first, but it's a powerful feature that helps prevent bugs and makes your code more reliable. Rust achieves a balance between performance and safety, leveraging its strict ownership model to prevent common programming errors while still being highly performant.\nPython uses a different approach to memory management, relying on garbage collection to handle memory allocation and deallocation so you generally don't have to worry about these details.\nI still have a lot to learn about the nuances of ownership and borrowing in Rust, but I hope this post gives you a good starting point.\n","id":"https://rsbit.es/ownership-and-borrowing/","title":"Ownership and borrowing in Rust"},"https://rsbit.es/pages/":{"body":"","id":"https://rsbit.es/pages/","title":""},"https://rsbit.es/pages/about/":{"body":"Hi there, I am Bob Belderbos, a Python developer and coach with a passion for teaching &amp; learning programming.

And that's actually a good way to learn a new language: by building something you've already built with another language. You already know what you want to build, so you can focus on the new language.\nHow to use it?\nHere's how you can use it:\n\nCurious how it got this alias? It's because of the [[bin]] section in the Cargo.toml file:\n\nLearnings\nCode so far here.\nA couple of cool things I learned while building this:\n\nI used clap  again for the CLI, great library, see also this article.\n\nLike last time I am using attributes (derive macros) to define the CLI interface which is pretty concise:\n\nThis time around I learned that clap also supports environment variables. Here I use it to set the alarm sound file if not provided as an argument.\n\nI used the rodio crate to play the alarm sound. It's a simple and easy-to-use audio library. Next step is to figure out how to play an audio message in addition to the alarm sound.\n\n\nThat's a lot of unwrapping, I should probably handle the errors more gracefully, still a lot to learn ...\n\nI used the chrono crate to print the current time in the log messages:\n\n\nUnlike Python's datetime, Rust doesn't have a built-in way to format dates and times, so you need to use a crate for that. This is a common pattern in Rust: the standard library is kept small and you use crates for additional functionality.\nOther notable Python Standard Library packages you'll miss as a Pythonista for example are: random, re, csv, and json, but once you get used to just cargo adding the crates you need, you hardly notice the difference.\n\n\nI used the reqwest crate to download the default alarm sound. It's a simple and easy-to-use HTTP client, which I had already used for my Pybites Search app, see here.\n\n\nWhere in Python you use while True: to create an infinite loop, in Rust you use loop { ... }.\n\n\nYou can use thread::sleep to pause the execution of the program for a specified amount of time, which seems a fit for this app.\n\n\nLike Python, Rust has a Path struct (object) to work with file paths in a platform-independent way. I like structs in Rust, see also here.\n\n\nI use cfg!(target_os = \"windows\") to check if the OS is Windows. This is a built-in macro in Rust (in Python you'd use sys.platform or the platform module).\n\n\nImprovement ideas / next steps\nAlthough this is not very good Rust code yet, I'm happy with the progress so far, specially having a working program that does something useful.\nSome things to improve:\n\n\nPlay an audio message as mentioned.\n\n\nDownload the default alarm file to a sensible location or maybe a temp dir to not clutter the user's filesystem.\n\n\nHandle errors more gracefully, e.g. using Result instead of unwrap to better propagate errors.\n\n\nModularize the code more to learn how to work with multiple files / modules.\n\n\nLinting and formatting (and automate this with a pre-commit hook as I tend to do with Python, see here).\n\n\nAdd documentation (and host it somewhere, e.g. GitHub Pages).\n\n\nAdd tests (although this app being heavy on IO and time-based, probably not the best app to start to learn about testing in Rust lol).\n\n\nSo good for a couple of more articles here ...\nConclusion\nThe best way to learn is to build small projects! This way you learn to put things together which is an important skill in programming. You can also gradually increase the complexity of the projects you build.\nI'm happy with the progress so far and how this way of learning Rust constantly challenges me to learn more about the language and tooling.

I did an overview video of them you can watch here.\nRust's Approach\nRust, on the other hand, implements these functionalities as methods on iterator types.\nThis approach leverages Rust's strengths in type safety and performance. By chaining methods, Rust allows you to build complex operations in a concise and readable manner.\nExample Comparisons\nLet's compare some common operations using Python built-ins and Rust method chaining:\nmap\nPython:\n\nRust:\n\nfilter\nPython:\n\nRust:\n\nzip\nPython:\n\nRust:\n\nenumerate\nPython:\n\nRust:\n\nHow Method Chaining Works in Rust\nRust’s method chaining is possible because each method in the iterator chain returns another iterator. This allows you to call multiple methods in sequence. Here's a deeper dive into how this works:\nExample: Chaining map and filter\n\nQuite elegant, isn't it? Let's break down the steps:\nStep-by-Step Breakdown\n\n\nCreating the Iterator:\n\nThis creates an iterator over the references to the elements of the vector numbers.\n\n\nMapping Values:\n\nThe map method creates a new iterator that applies the given closure to each item, in this case, squaring the values.\n\n\nFiltering Values:\n\nThe filter method creates another iterator that only yields items for which the given predicate is true, in this case, retaining even numbers.\n\n\nCollecting Results:\n\nThe collect method consumes the iterator and collects the resulting items into a new collection, in this case, a vector.\n\n\nHow It Works Internally\nEach method (map, filter, etc.) returns a new iterator type. For example:\n\nnumbers.iter() returns an Iter iterator.\nIter has a method map that returns a Map&lt;Iter, F&gt; iterator.\nMap&lt;Iter, F&gt; has a method filter that returns a Filter&lt;Map&lt;Iter, F&gt;, G&gt; iterator.\n\nThese iterator types (Iter, Map, Filter) all implement the Iterator trait, allowing them to be chained together seamlessly.\nIn Python we really like generators and lazy operations (meaning any computation is only done when needed). Rust iterators are also lazy by default, which can lead to significant performance improvements, especially when working with large collections.\n\nTraits are a fundamental feature in Rust that allow you to define shared behavior across different types. A trait is a collection of methods defined for an unknown type: Self. Traits can be implemented for any data type. In this case, the Iterator trait provides a common interface for all iterators, enabling method chaining.\nBy implementing the Iterator trait, a type gains the ability to be iterated over using methods like map, filter, and collect. This trait-based approach ensures that any type that implements Iterator can seamlessly integrate with Rust's powerful iterator combinators, promoting code reuse and modularity.\nA dedicated article to follow on this topic...\nBenefits of Chaining\n\nReadability: Method chaining provides a clear and concise way to express a series of operations on a collection.\nPerformance: Iterators in Rust are lazy and can be highly optimized by the compiler. Operations are performed only when needed.\nExtensibility: By implementing the Iterator trait for custom types, you can leverage all the powerful methods available on iterators.\n\nPractice This\nPractice iterators on the Pybites Rust Platform:\n\nIterator Basics\nMap and Filter\nIterator Chaining\n\nConclusion\nSo what are Python's robust and performant built-ins in Rust? You'll often find them as methods on iterator types, allowing you to chain operations together in a fluent and efficient manner. 😍 📈\nI hope this comparison has given you a better understanding of how Rust's method chaining with iterators can be a powerful tool in your programming arsenal.

Here's how I did it.\nFull code in this repo.\nAfter adding image to your Cargo.toml or doing a cargo add image you can use it like this.\nFirst you make an image object:\n\nHere is the original image:\n\n  \n  \n    \n    \n  \n  \n\nThe ? operator is a concise way to handle errors, if image::open fails it will return an error and the function will return early.\nNext we can use the resize_exact method to resize the image to the desired width and height:\n\nThe FilterType is optional, it defaults to Lanczos3 which is a high-quality resampling filter.\nFinally we can save the resized image to disk:\n\n\n  \n  \n    \n    \n  \n  \n\nThat's a bit skewed though, because the original image was 800x600 and we resized it to 200x200. If you want to keep the aspect ratio you can use the resize method instead of resize_exact:\n\nThat leads to an image of 200x150 in my case which looks better:\n\n  \n  \n    \n    \n  \n  \n\nPutting it all together:\n\nNote that because we're using the ? operator we need to update the return type of our function to Result&lt;(), ImageError&gt;.\nThe repo has some other interesting things:\n\n\nI use clap to parse command line arguments, see also this article.\n\n\nI use img.save_with_format(output_path, ImageFormat::Png)?; to save the image in a different format (ChatGPT gave me webp fake images so I converted them to png).\n\n\nIt uses glob (similar to Python's glob) with a pattern (\"{}/*{}\") to find all files in a directory with a certain extension, which can be provided as an argument to the program.\n\n\nI use the match statement to handle errors and print messages to the console in various places.\n\n\nConclusion\nThere you go, a quick way to resize images in Rust.\nThe image crate is powerful and easy to use, similar to Pillow in Python. 😍 📈\nYou can use the resize method to keep the aspect ratio or resize_exact to resize to an exact width and height.\nAgain, the full code of this mini project is here.\n","id":"https://rsbit.es/resizing-images/","title":"How to resize images in Rust"},"https://rsbit.es/rust-analyzer-ale-errors-while-coding/":{"body":"The more advanced you become as a developer the more you realize that the speed of coding is not just about language syntax or typing, it's as much about the tools and techniques you use.\nOne of my best Python coding setup tweaks has been showing errors upon saving files, for which I use this plugin. This speeds up development significantly! 😍 📈\nI wanted to do the same for Rust coding, specially because there is, compared to Python, an extra compilation step in Rust.\nIn this article I'll show you how I have set it up ...\nNote that I use Vim as my text editor and Mac as my operating system. I hope most of the setup is easily transferable to other text editors and operating systems. Or that at least it gets you thinking about how you can speed up your coding workflow. 💡\nInstall rust-analyzer\nFirst, you need to install rust-analyzer. I did this with brew:\n\nInstall ALE, the Asynchronous Lint Engine\nI use Vundle as my Vim plugin manager so I added this plugin to my .vimrc:\n\nAnd installed it with:\n\nSetup in .vimrc\nI added the following code to my .vimrc.

Tweak these settings as you see fit.\n\n\nPlaying around with this plugin I added some more settings to my .vimrc:\n\nSee it in action\nHere is some code to try this on:\n\nLet's make a couple of errors and see the ALE checker in action 💡 🚀\n\nchanging mod data; to mod data\n\n\n\ndata to data2 which is not defined\n\n\n\nremoving a use statement\n\n\n\nremoving the #[tokio::main] attribute\n\n\n\nremoving the async keyword\n\n\nSpecially the ale_open_list and ale_set_quickfix settings are useful.

Unlike Python's optional type hints, Rust's type hints are mandatory.\nThe PyResult in the sum_squares function signature is the return type of functions that can return errors. This is needed because the add_function method can return an error. The ? operator is used to propagate the error if it occurs.\nThe Ok(()) expression is used to return a successful result. () is the unit type, which is similar to void in other languages.\n\nCreate a Python package\nFirst make a virtual environment, enable it, and install the maturin package:\n\nNormally you would run maturin init to create a new Python package, but in this case we already have a Cargo project, so we can skip this step.\nLet's build the Python package using Maturin:\n\nIt worked but I did get this warning:\n\nTo fix this error, I updated the function signature to use &amp;Bound&lt;'_, PyModule&gt; instead of &amp;PyModule:\n\nAfter that change, I ran maturin develop again and the warning was gone:\n\nI can now see the shared library (.so file) in my virtual environment:\n\nAnd I can import it in the Python REPL:\n\nThat's it! We have successfully built a Python package with Rust code using PyO3 and Maturin.\nI have not pushed one to PyPI, but you can do that by running maturin publish. I will blog here when I have done that for a real project ...\nLastly, to see how it performs vs some Python code, I created a test.py file:\n\nRunning it:\n\nNice, the Rust implementation is about 3x faster than the Python implementation. But that's not the point of this article, the point is to show you how to run Rust code in Python which opens up exciting new opportunities for performance improvements in your Python code. 😍 📈\nThis is how Pydantic, the data validation library, is speeding up its codebase I believe. 😎\nConclusion\nIn this article, we learned how to run Rust code in Python using PyO3 and Maturin.

But Rust's iterator methods let you express the same logic in fewer lines, with less room for bugs. One small function shows the difference clearly.\nThe Imperative Instinct\nWhen asked to sum a slice of integers, the instinct is a classic accumulator loop:\n\nA mutable variable, an explicit loop, and a trailing return. It works, but it forces the reader to trace state through the body to understand intent.\nThe Functional Alternative\nHere's the same logic using Rust's iterator combinators:\n\nThat's it. One line that reads almost like English: iterate over the slice, sum everything.\nNo mutable accumulator. No explicit loop. No room for bugs.\nWhy This Works\nRust's Iterator trait provides a rich set of composable methods.\niter().sum() works because sum() is a consuming adaptor. It takes ownership of the iterator, accumulates every element using the Sum trait, and returns the result. The type system infers i32 from the function signature, so you don't even need a turbofish (::&lt;Type&gt; annotation). If the compiler couldn't infer the type, you'd write v.iter().sum::&lt;i32&gt;() instead.\nThe Sum trait is more powerful than it looks. It's also implemented for Option&lt;T&gt; and Result&lt;T, E&gt;, which means you can sum a list that might contain missing or failed values — no manual if checks needed:\n\nIf all elements are Some(n), you get Some(total). If any element is None, the whole result is None. In many languages, this would require a messy loop with null checks.\nZero-Cost Abstractions\nIn Python or JavaScript, chaining higher-order functions like map and filter typically allocates intermediate collections at each step. In Rust, it doesn't. Rust iterators use a pull model — nothing happens until something consumes the chain. The compiler inlines the entire pipeline and optimizes it into a single tight loop, the same machine code you'd get from writing the for loop by hand.\nThis is what Rust means by zero-cost abstractions: you don't pay a runtime price for the higher-level expression. No heap allocations for intermediate results, no virtual dispatch, no hidden overhead. The abstraction exists at compile time and disappears in the binary.\nIn fact, the iterator version can sometimes be faster than a hand-written loop. The compiler may apply SIMD (Single Instruction, Multiple Data) optimizations to iter().sum(), summing multiple numbers in a single CPU instruction — an optimization that's harder to trigger with a manual accumulator loop.\nThat's the deal Rust offers — write the clearer version and trust the compiler to make it at least as fast, sometimes faster.\nWhen to Reach for Iterators\nIterators shine when the operation maps to a well-known pattern:\n\nSumming: iter().sum()\nTransforming: iter().map(f).collect()\nFiltering: iter().filter(p).collect()\nMutating in place: iter_mut().for_each(f)\nFinding: iter().find(p)\nChecking conditions: iter().all(p) / iter().any(p) (just like Python's all() and any(), but as iterator methods instead of free functions)\n\nIf your loop body does one of these things, the iterator version is almost always clearer.\nThat said, a for loop is still the right choice when the logic is highly stateful, involves complex early breaks, or doesn't map cleanly to a single combinator. Iterators replace boilerplate loops, not all loops.\nKey Takeaways\n\nRust iterators express intent directly, removing boilerplate state management\niter() borrows, iter_mut() borrows mutably, into_iter() takes ownership — pick the one that matches your access pattern (see Ownership and Borrowing for a refresher)\nZero-cost abstractions mean you get clarity without sacrificing performance\nOne-liner iterator chains are not \"clever code\" — they're idiomatic Rust\n\nPractice This\nTry the Vectors and Slices exercise on Pybites Rust Platform and see how far you can get without writing a single for loop.\n","id":"https://rsbit.es/rust-iterators-over-loops-one-function-that-shows-why/","title":"Rust iterators over loops: one function that shows why"},"https://rsbit.es/rust-no-none-crashes/":{"body":"Every Python developer has seen this traceback:\n\nThe problem is that tests might miss this so it shows up in production, and that could be at 2 am in the morning.\nThe pattern that causes it is everywhere:\n\nNothing in Python warns you that find_user might return None. No type error, no warning, no compile-time check. The code looks perfectly fine — until it isn't.\nTony Hoare, who invented null references, called it his \"billion-dollar mistake\". Every language that has implicit nulls inherits this problem. Python included.\nRust refuses to compile the bug\nRust does have a None scenario, but it's handled differently. It has Option&lt;T&gt; — an enum with exactly two variants:\n\nWhen a function might not have a value to return, it says so in its type signature:\n\nFair enough, Pythonistas certainly want to add type hints to express this too:\n\nOr more modern syntax:\n\nBut here is the key difference: where in Python you're relying on tooling (mypy, ty) to catch this, in Rust using the result type without handling the None case, the code does not compile:\n\nThe compiler forces you to acknowledge that the value might not be there:\n\nThis means no AttributeError and no unexpected runtime crash. The bug literally cannot exist in the compiled program.\nIt's not just match statements\nIf match on every Option sounds tedious, it is — and Rust has ergonomic shortcuts. The .map() combinator transforms the inner value while keeping the Option wrapper:\n\nThis is an elegant way to express Python's x.upper() if x is not None else None which might feel a bit clunky at times.\nThere's also .unwrap_or() for defaults, .is_some() for checks, and if let for quick pattern matches. The full API has dozens of combinators — all with the advantage of compile-time safety.\nWhat this means in practice\nThink about how many defensive checks you write in Python:\n\nEach is not None check exists because the language can't guarantee the value is there. You're doing the compiler's job manually — and across a larger codebase, it's easy to miss one.\nIn Rust, the type system tracks presence and absence through every function call, every transformation, every return value. If you forget to handle a None, you find out immediately — in your editor, not your error logs.\nThis isn't just theory. It's the reason Rust programs don't have an entire class of bugs right out of the box.\nTry it yourself\nWe built a hands-on exercise that lets you practice this pattern. You'll implement three functions that return Option&lt;T&gt; — finding values in slices, handling division by zero, and extracting fields from optional structs.\nOption Handling\nI hope this gives you a feel for what it's like to write safer code.\n\nIf you're a Python developer curious about Rust, our Rust Platform teaches Rust concepts through small, focused exercises — each one bridging what you already know in Python to how Rust does it differently (and often better).\n","id":"https://rsbit.es/rust-no-none-crashes/","title":"Rust Makes None.attribute Crashes Impossible — Your Code Won't Even Compile"},"https://rsbit.es/rustlings-exercises-to-practice-rust/":{"body":"I have been going through the Rustlings exercises and I have found them to be a great way to practice Rust. 🔥\nAs I said in a previous post, it's all about pratice. 💡\nRust is also a language that requires some time to get used to, specially when coming from a dynamic language like Python.

The usize type is an unsigned integer, meaning that it cannot be negative.\nRanges in Rust (vs Python)\nThe 0..N construct is similar to range in Python, where the upper bound is also exclusive. Also in both languages, the lower bound is inclusive. To make the upper bound inclusive, you can use 0..=N in Rust. So I could also write 1..=args.times to play the message args.times times.\nYou can also use std::iter::repeat here I learned:\n\nBut that seems more verbose and complicated than the more concise and readable for loop so I stuck with that.\nSo running the program like this it will say \"Wake up\" 3 times after 3 seconds:\n\nWhy 3 times? By not specifying the number of times, it will default to 3 (see the TIMES_TO_PLAY constant).\nConclusion\nI like the current 0.3.0 (available on crates.io) better than the previous ones, where I was playing an alarm file. This had the added complexity of downloading and playing an audio file.\nThe text-to-speech feature is less code relatively and actually tells the user what the alarm is about. The only thing is compatibility, I need to test it on Windows and Linux still ...\nAs usual, by building things I've learned more about interesting Rust features and idioms. I am also getting more comfortable with the language and its ecosystem. 😍 📈\nI will probably use this project to write some more posts about 1. code structuring (modularizing your code), 2. testing and 3. documentation. Stay tuned! 🚀\n","id":"https://rsbit.es/tts-in-rust/","title":"Alarm clock part II - text to speech"},"https://rsbit.es/upload-file-to-s3/":{"body":"A while ago I made a Python script to upload files to an S3 bucket. It's a simple script that uses the boto3 library to interact with the AWS API. Check it out here.\nLet's see how to do this with Rust and the rusoto crate.\nFirst, I added the following dependencies to my Cargo.toml file:\n\nThis is what I came up with for the first iteration:\n\n\nI use Clap (as usual) for handling command-line arguments.\nI use the rusoto_core and rusoto_s3 crates to interact with the AWS API.\nI use the tokio crate to make it asynchronous.\nThe upload_image_to_s3 function reads the file, creates a PutObjectRequest, and uploads the file to the specified S3 bucket.\nThe main function parses the command-line arguments, extracts the file name, and uploads the file to S3.\n\nTo run the program, you need to set the AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID and AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY environment variables:\n\nAnd either specify region and bucket from the command line or set the S3_BUCKET_NAME and AWS_REGION environment variables if you always want to use the same bucket and region:\n\nWith all this set you only need to give the file you want to upload:\n\nConclusion\nAnd that's it, a Rust utitlity to upload files to S3. 🚀\nI extended the program a bit to allow multiple files to be uploaded and list the images, including with pagination so I can use it later with HTMX' infinite scroll. I will write about that in a future post ...\nThe repo is here and I pushed it to crates.io as well. 🦀\n","id":"https://rsbit.es/upload-file-to-s3/","title":"Using rusoto to upload a file to S3"},"https://rsbit.es/writing-a-rust-code-validation-api/":{"body":"Today I managed to add support for Rust exercises on our platform. I struggled with getting cargo test to work on AWS Lambda for a week (talking about tunnel vision), so it was time to pivot to a different approach.\nIt turns out that I needed a bit more resource power and Heroku did it for me. So I dropped AWS Gateway API + AWS Lambda (what we normally use to validate coding exercises) and wrote my first Rust API to run tests on code.\nThe final version is a bit more involved, because it gets the code from our platform's API. To keep it simple, I omitted this part here.\nUsing Axtix-web to build an API\nHere is the code:\n\nDependencies used (in Cargo.toml):\n\nSome highlights:\n\n\nRequest and Response are the structs for the request and response bodies.\n\n\nMaking an API is relatively simple with the actix-web crate. The main function starts an HTTP server that listens on port 8080. I did have to make the port configurable with an environment variable for Heroku, but I omitted this part from the code for this post.\n\n\nexecute_code is the handler for the /execute endpoint. It receives the code and tests, writes them to a temporary file, and runs cargo test on it. For this to work, the code and tests are concatenated into a single file and we write a Cargo.toml file with the base metadata.\n\n\nThe code is written to a temporary directory using the tempfile crate.\n\n\nTo make it a bit more secure, I added an API key check. If the API key is missing or invalid, the API returns an unauthorized response.\n\n\nHere is the repo if you want to play with it yourself.\nTesting the API\nAs you can see in the README I added two test examples of a good vs failing test:\n\nConclusion\nAs a nice side effect of wanting to support Rust exercises on our platform, I learned how to build a simple API in Rust.\nAs mentioned I deployed it to Heroku, for which I had to use Docker to build the image, and then push it to Heroku's container registry.

Cosmetic, easy.\n2. -&gt; String is required. Python type hints are optional documentation. Rust return types are mandatory — the compiler uses them.\n3. No return keyword. The last expression (without a semicolon) is the return value. Add a semicolon and it becomes a statement that returns nothing — a common gotcha.\n4. String vs str. Python has one string type. Rust has two: &amp;str (borrowed slice, like a read-only view) and String (owned, heap-allocated). The literal \"Hello\" is a &amp;str. .to_string() converts it to an owned String.\nThat fourth point is the one that will take the longest to internalize. For now, just remember: Rust has two string types, and you need to choose the right one for your function's return type: literals are &amp;str, owned data is String, and .to_string() bridges them.\nPractice this\nTry these exercises on the Pybites Rust Platform:\n\nHello, Rustacean! — your first Rust function, returning a String\nFunctions and Return Values — practice fn, return types, and implicit returns\nStrings and Slices — get comfortable with &amp;str vs String\n\n","id":"https://rsbit.es/your-first-rust-function/","title":"Your first Rust function (from a Python perspective)"}},"docInfo":{"https://rsbit.es/":{"body":0,"title":0},"https://rsbit.es/25-days-learning-rust-takeaways/":{"body":386,"title":6},"https://rsbit.es/adding-auth-to-an-api/":{"body":385,"title":6},"https://rsbit.es/automating-test-runs-and-checking-coverage/":{"body":67,"title":5},"https://rsbit.es/blog-with-zola/":{"body":512,"title":7},"https://rsbit.es/building-website-axum/":{"body":485,"title":6},"https://rsbit.es/cargo-like-poetry/":{"body":241,"title":5},"https://rsbit.es/command-line-apps-with-clap/":{"body":209,"title":6},"https://rsbit.es/constant-hashmap-lookup/":{"body":151,"title":4},"https://rsbit.es/constants-python-vs-rust/":{"body":184,"title":4},"https://rsbit.es/convert-markdown-to-html-script/":{"body":231,"title":5},"https://rsbit.es/deploy-rust-app-to-heroku/":{"body":183,"title":4},"https://rsbit.es/environment-variables-rust/":{"body":334,"title":4},"https://rsbit.es/exception-handling-in-rust/":{"body":219,"title":3},"https://rsbit.es/from-script-to-library-in-rust/":{"body":359,"title":3},"https://rsbit.es/linting-with-clippy/":{"body":283,"title":4},"https://rsbit.es/my-first-post/":{"body":184,"title":2},"https://rsbit.es/namedtuple-in-rust-struct/":{"body":280,"title":4},"https://rsbit.es/ownership-and-borrowing/":{"body":338,"title":3},"https://rsbit.es/pages/":{"body":0,"title":0},"https://rsbit.es/pages/about/":{"body":157,"title":0},"https://rsbit.es/pages/archive/":{"body":0,"title":1},"https://rsbit.es/pages/search/":{"body":0,"title":1},"https://rsbit.es/play-alarm-from-command-line/":{"body":425,"title":6},"https://rsbit.es/pybites-search-caching-serde-json/":{"body":210,"title":6},"https://rsbit.es/pybites-search-in-rust/":{"body":315,"title":4},"https://rsbit.es/python-builtins-rust-chaining/":{"body":428,"title":8},"https://rsbit.es/resizing-images/":{"body":188,"title":3},"https://rsbit.es/rust-analyzer-ale-errors-while-coding/":{"body":300,"title":8},"https://rsbit.es/rust-in-python-pyo3-maturin/":{"body":385,"title":5},"https://rsbit.es/rust-iterators-over-loops-one-function-that-shows-why/":{"body":386,"title":7},"https://rsbit.es/rust-no-none-crashes/":{"body":278,"title":9},"https://rsbit.es/rustlings-exercises-to-practice-rust/":{"body":206,"title":7},"https://rsbit.es/shipped-first-crate/":{"body":176,"title":6},"https://rsbit.es/testing-in-rust/":{"body":259,"title":4},"https://rsbit.es/tts-in-rust/":{"body":296,"title":6},"https://rsbit.es/upload-file-to-s3/":{"body":138,"title":5},"https://rsbit.es/writing-a-rust-code-validation-api/":{"body":197,"title":5},"https://rsbit.es/your-first-rust-function/":{"body":129,"title":5}},"length":39},"lang":"English"};
